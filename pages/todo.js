        "On the first point just have a look at whether that's intended to be there. Regarding hyperlinking I imagine there's to common approaches to this, one being a link or tooltip to the bibliography, the other a link to an external source. Would be great to decide on a single or combined approach for consistency.",

      notes:
        "How did that happen?! I didn't even notice, but yeah. That's weird. Will add things back here. Update: I see what happened. I referred to Wolf and Chomsky in my introduction, then said that Explorable Explanations was the only real example I could find that directly addressed what I'm going for. That was by design, but I do have some ideas I can pull in here to make the literature review more robust. Stay tuned.",
