            <h2>Research overview</h2>
            <p>
              This work will explore the promising and overlooked space between
              standard text-based HTML content and fully interactive software.
              Scholars and inventors as far back as Alan Kay (2003) have called
              for the creation of “active essays” and more recently Bret Victor
              has advocated for Explorable Explanations, (2011) which inspired
              powerful new works such as the Pulitzer-winning Snowfall from the
              New York Times (2012). Still, the practice is outside the
              mainstream, and examples are only lightly researched and
              understood. The premise of this approach is that writing isn’t
              just something to be consumed passively via text and links, but is
              instead can b an environment to think in. My research portfolio
              will explain the concepts and promise of this approach alongside
              several embedded code examples to further illustrate the concepts.
            </p>
            <h2>Research project description</h2>
            <p>
              The research will feature a survey of innovative and influential
              examples of augmented text to date. From these sources, I will
              distill core concepts, strategies, and approaches that have proven
              successful in engaging readers and enhancing understanding. The
              central focus of my work will be contributing to this
              under-appreciated field. To achieve this, I'll build a
              comprehensive feature library featuring practical, applicable
              examples of augmented text techniques to be hosted online on a
              custom domain indefinitely.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each pattern in the library will be accompanied by working code
              and an interactive prototype. These will serve as a springboard
              for future exploration and innovation by designers and developers.
              This pattern library will stand as a practical, hands-on companion
              to the theoretical knowledge drawn from my research.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each UX feature in the library will be accompanied by working code
              and an interactive prototype. These will serve as a springboard
              for future exploration and innovation by designers and developers.
              This feature library will stand as a practical, hands-on companion
              to the theoretical knowledge drawn from my research.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this project, I am aiming to do more than just synthesise what
              has been done. I hope to inspire, enabling others to build on past
              achievements and explore new frontiers in the realm of responsive
              communication. After reading my work, readers will not only
              appreciate the art of what's been done in the past but will also
              be equipped to add to the future of augmented text and responsive
              communication, by referring to the feature library I have
              prepared.
            </p>
            <h2>Research methods</h2>

            <p>
              My research methodology will rely on on two methods: a literature
              review and a contextual analysis. I’ve used both of these
              techniques during my time working in industry, and originally
              learned them as an undergrad in 1998 when I was studying for my
              degree in Multimedia & Web Design. I will be will be relying on my
              extensive experience in the field as a practicing software
              designer and design educator to help explain the historical and
              cultural backdrop I’ll be placing “Augmented Text” against.
            </p>
            <p>
              The literature review will examine scholarly articles, case
              studies, and existing research to identify key developments,
              successful methods, and emerging patterns. This theoretical
              groundwork (Fink, 2019) will inform the subsequent stages of my
              research.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next I’ll take this material and use it to conduct a contextual
              analysis. I will be placing special emphasis on the the
              similarities and differences between traditional HCI concepts,
              which have been well-researched, and my area of interest, which
              have not. An apt comparison is an experienced jazz musician
              discovering and researching rap, then an emerging art form. Back
              then, it was hard to describe rap because it was not quite disco,
              not quite jazz, and not quite spoken word, but with elements of
              all three. In this way, “Augmented Text” has similarities with
              traditional UX or game design, but has the potential to be as
              differentiated as rap has proven to be from disco.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, I’ll publish and host an open-source feature library,
              inspired by the principles outlined in 'A Pattern Language: Towns,
              Buildings, Construction' by Alexander, Ishikawa, and Silverstein
              (1977), to ensure my research contributes new knowledge to the
              field rather than solely reporting on pre-existing studies. The
              features will be informed by the insights derived from the
              literature review and contextual analysis, contemporary practices,
              and my own design explorations. I discuss this more in the output
              section below.
            </p>

            <h2>Research outputs</h2>
            <p>
              By applying the insights gained from the literature review and
              contextual inquiry to the creation of the feature library, I aim
              to provide a comprehensive, practical, and innovative resource for
              those interested in the concepts of Augmented Text and Responsive
              Communication. My research aims to contextualise this emerging
              communication style, and inspire others to build on it, rather
              than attempt to quantify it. To return to the 1982 rap metaphor,
              establishing which rap song is best is beyond the scope of my
              research. Instead, I’m seeking to show that this new approach
              exists, and inspire others to action by using inspiring,
              informative, open-sourced examples.
            </p>
            <p>
              The centrepiece of this approach is a research portfolio that lays
              out the history, theory, and application of Augmented Text and
              Responsive Communication. This document will be available in PDF
              form for traditional academic consumption.
            </p>
            <p>
              The same content will be presented as an interactive online essay,
              hosted indefinitely on my own domain. This digital rendition will
              incorporate live examples of augmented text and responsive
              communication, creating an experiential learning environment for
              readers and embodying the principles it discusses. The concepts
              I’m addressing can only be properly expressed with interactive
              media. Indeed, this is a central premise that I will be addressing
              in detail in the portfolio.
            </p>

            <p>
              Throughout the essay hosted online, I will make references to code
              samples that I will host alongside the main work. This practical
              resource will host a collection of interactive features drawn from
              my research, each one a fully functioning example of Augmented
              Text. It is my hope that this feature library will not only
              illustrate the concepts discussed in the research paper but will
              also serve as a source of inspiration and a toolkit for other
              designers and developers venturing into this exciting frontier of
              digital communication.

            <p>
              This month will be used for gathering resources, refining the

              With the knowledge already gained in the field, a preliminary
              draft of the entire research paper will be constructed. This is a
              methodology that has proven successful in industry
              settings---create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) quickly and
              proceed to iterate based on its foundation. This is non-standard
              because a literature review typically comes first, but this will
              give me the best chance of success because it gives me more time
              to iterate.
