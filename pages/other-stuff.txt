### Notes to keep in mind since last time

- Click-to-expand app is a good thing to explore and expand on
- Right-click to translate is a good thing at the OS level, but providing other options are good. \<— I forget what this note meant
- William recommended [https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/biggestideas/][2] and said that could be a fantastic way to explain text
- Multi-touch versus scrolljacking — William has interesting points about this
- Good article: https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/ uploads/2019/04/how_playful_learning_can_help_leapfrog_progress_in_education.pdf

Summary so far:

- The written word was a big innovation
- Now it’s networked and we have multimedia
- But between multimedia and games, there’s this interesting space
- Here are three important works: explorable explanations, snowfall, the web’s grain
- Explorable explanations is about making text into a place to learn
- Then snowfall showed this off and won a pulitzer
- It blended everything together in an important way
- Tangible feature #1: elements reacted to your scroll position
- Tangible features #2-#4: interactivity, layout, and animation
