# Augmented Text

## Abstract

**Introduction to Augmented Text**
Traditional reading was an analog experience, with no interactivity. On the other hand, the modern experience of multimedia is often very interactive but harder to read with the same flow as a book. Augmented Text aims to take the best from both worlds, the feeling of flow while reading a book, but with the assistance of software.

**Research Objective**
This work addresses one question: How can we enhance the reading experience through technology without compromising the essence of traditional reading? It utilities a methodology that combines qualitative and quantitative approaches in order to quantify the "essence" of traditional reading with enhancements that benefit readers of educational and informational content.


## Introduction

#### Reading is not natural, and comprehension is hard
The evolution of literacy, as explored in "Proust and the Squid" by Maryanne Wolf **\[ADD CITATION\]**, underscores the intricate cognitive processes involved in reading and understanding text. Wolf's analysis reveals that reading is not an innate human ability but a complex skill that our brains have adapted to perform over thousands of years, fundamentally changing the way we think, communicate, and perceive the world​​​[](https://mindfultechnics.com/proust-and-the-squid-book-review/)​. Reading, as opposed to simply hearing words, activates a unique interplay of brain circuits, fostering deeper comprehension and critical thinking. This is in stark contrast to oral traditions, which Noam Chomsky **\[ADD CITATION\]** and others have established are innate to the human experience, and require less effort to master.

Because comprehending the written word is such a specialised process, humankind has long relied on tools and intermediaries to not just read, but to more deeply comprehend and understand. **\[ADD SEVERAL CITATIONS\]** Educational institutions and religious organisations are the most obvious examples at a societal level, but it can be argued that most of human experience isn't about the lived experience, but making sense of it. This means that comprehension, not just experience, is a focal point for society. From the ancient scribes of organised religions who transcribed sacred texts, making the profound teachings accessible to a broader audience, to the establishment of universities in the medieval period, which became centres for scholarly study and interpretation of complex works, these intermediaries have been instrumental in the dissemination of knowledge. They not only provided the tools for literacy but also fostered an environment where comprehension and critical thinking were cultivated.

#### Software can help with comprehension, but adds complexity
With the development of the printing press and then the internet, the volume of things to read and experience increased exponentially, but the ability to comprehend is still at a premium. Educational and media organisations who initially turned to multimedia such as audio and video then discovered more complex forms of educational software to assist with comprehending information, from explainer videos to interactive data visualisations to simulations and educational software. While this has happened, the rise of more shallow **\[ADD CITATION\]** reading patterns in the digital age has brought up questions about the potential impact on deep thinking, understanding, and comprehension. We've never had more media to consume, and more ways to understand it, leading to a bounty of opportunity but also a feeling of overwhelm. **\[ADD CITATION\]** We have more ways than ever to be helped, but are those helpful features distracting from the essence and comprehension of a reading experience?

Bret Victor's concepts of Explorable Explanations **\[ADD CITATION\]** and Alan Kay's Active Essays **\[ADD CITATION\]** stand out as pioneering examples of how text can be augmented to offer more interactive and immersive learning experiences. These innovations allow readers to engage with content in dynamic ways, enabling a deeper exploration of topics and concepts through interactive visuals, simulations, and embedded coding environments. However, this evolution towards increasingly feature-rich digital texts brings forth a critical question: at what point does the augmentation of books with software and interactive elements detract from the essence of traditional reading? **\[EXPAND THIS SECTION TALKING MORE ABOUT EXPLORABLE EXPLANATIONS\]**

"The Web's Grain," a critique on digital text design, serves as a cautionary reference point, highlighting the potential pitfalls of over-augmentation. It suggests that there exists a delicate balance between enhancing the readability and educational value of text through digital means and preserving the core experience of reading that books have offered for centuries. The challenge lies in integrating technological advancements in a way that complements rather than overwhelms the fundamental nature of reading, ensuring that books retain their intrinsic value as a medium for thought, reflection, and learning in the digital age. **\[ADD SNOWFALL HERE\]**

#### Literature Review

**Where this research aims to fill gaps**
Between Wolf, Chomsky, and many others, we have ample academic grounding to understand much about the ability of the human mind to hear, read, and comprehend information. Thanks to the efforts of the HCI community, especially Neilson and Raskin, we have plenty of data about what makes an interface successful, or indeed in the words of Raskin, what makes it not just a "human interface" but a "humane" one. And due to the efforts of **CITATIONS NEEDED** studying educational theory, we know what aids reading comprehension both in and outside the classroom. And yet despite the depth of research found across these fields, it was harder to find the same rich academic research in the overlap between these three broad categories.

One notable branch of work was Bret Victor's Explorable Explanations, which inspired a cottage industry of works animated by his core concepts. This work was the original aim of my research, because I believed that his vision of augmenting text with bits of software to help comprehension was worthy of study and iteration. Through my literature review of the work his essay inspired, I noticed some key themes:

(Lots of citations will go here, stay tuned)

#### The central question we're looking to address

> How much can we enhance the reading experience through technology without compromising the essence of traditional reading?

This inquiry seeks to find a sweet spot between software and traditional books, where the augmentation of text with digital tools enriches the reader's engagement and understanding without eroding the fundamental experience of reading—a practice deeply rooted in human culture and cognitive processes.

To address this, the research will explore a spectrum of experiences that range from the simplicity of traditional books to the complexity of experimental interactive software. This exploration aims to identify strategies and methodologies that preserve the core of reading while leveraging the potential of modern technology to make texts more accessible, interactive, and engaging. By examining instances where multimedia integration has either stalled or failed to enhance the reading experience, such as in the stagnation of multimedia or the limited impact of games in this context, the study will highlight the limitations of current approaches.

Furthermore, the assertion that clinging solely to the traditional reading experience is inadequate in today's digital age underpins the necessity for a nuanced approach. This research advocates for a middle ground that respects the timeless value of literacy and the contemplative nature of reading, while embracing the possibilities that digital innovations offer for making texts more alive, interactive, and tailored to individual learning styles.

Through a methodological framework that includes both theoretical analysis and practical experimentation, this study aims to contribute to the ongoing dialogue about the evolution of reading in the digital era. It will seek to offer insights and recommendations for designers, educators, and content creators on how to craft reading experiences that are both enriched by technology and deeply respectful of the literary tradition that has shaped human thought and culture for millennia.

(TODO: accessibility)
## Methodology

#### Methodological Overview
This work employs a mixed-methods approach. First, it uses the Touch Level Model (TLM) **\[ADD CITATION\]** for comparative analysis of different reading-based interactions, such as the scoring the relative time it takes to access a footnote in print versus digital formats. Next, Nielsen's Heuristic Evaluation **\[ADD CITATION\]** is utilised to assess four key areas: Flow, Utility, Development Effort, and Customisation Effort. These four metrics provide a qualitative measure of the augmented text's design and usability, and will be defined in further detail below. Finally, we'll factor in Raskin's Efficiency Score **\[ADD CITATION\]** , an analysis of Fitts' Law **\[ADD CITATION\]** , and Hick's Law **\[ADD CITATION\]** . By scoring interactions across multiple heuristics, we aim to provide a wide-ranging score that helps understand the pros and cons of each approach.
    
#### Criteria Definition
To develop a comprehensive evaluation model for augmented text, the methodology combines several components, each contributing unique insights:

1. **Touch Level Model (TLM):** Quantifies touch interactions, providing a baseline for comparing the efficiency of gestures and taps in augmented texts.
2. **Flow:** Measures how seamlessly users can navigate and engage with the text, emphasising the importance of a distraction-free reading experience.
3. **Utility:** Evaluates the added value of augmented features in enhancing understanding and engagement, highlighting the relevance and effectiveness of these enhancements.
4. **Development Effort:** Assesses the resources required to implement augmented features, considering both time and technical complexity.
5. **Customization Effort:** Examines the ease with which users can personalise their reading experience, reflecting on user autonomy and adaptability.
6. **Raskin's Efficiency Measures:** Applies a broader view of information efficiency, focusing on how effectively augmented text conveys information with minimal user effort.
7. **Fitts’ Law:** Integrates principles of human motor system behavior to evaluate the physical ease of interacting with augmented text features.
8. **Hick’s Law:** Considers the cognitive load in decision-making, particularly how feature variety and complexity impact user choices and response times.

Combining these elements provides a holistic view, balancing objective performance metrics with subjective user experience assessments. This "cocktail" of data offers a nuanced understanding of augmented text's impact, guiding optimisations that enhance readability, engagement, and ease of use without compromising the essence of reading

#### Approach
This study will analyse a variety of reading tasks that individuals may encounter, utilising a custom "report card" to score different approaches to augmented text. By assessing how each approach fares against specific criteria such as flow, utility, development effort, and customisation effort, the study will provide a personalised evaluation of the effectiveness of various augmented reading experiences. This method allows for a nuanced comparison of how different technologies and design choices impact the reading process.

#### Limitations and Concepts Out of Scope

**Analysis of Augmented Text**

The study examines augmented text from a theoretical perspective, prioritising a design-centric analysis over empirical data. The lack of objective task completion times and effectiveness data means that the conclusions drawn are more conceptual than quantitative, emphasising the potential and theoretical applications of augmented text features. The absence of diverse user testing leaves room for future research to explore how different user groups interact with and benefit from these text augmentations.

**Focus on Theoretical Evaluation**

By choosing to evaluate augmented text through a theoretical lens, the study emphasises the designer's intent and the anticipated user experience. This approach allows for a concentrated examination of the design principles that underpin augmented text, although it does not measure actual user interactions or satisfaction.

**Accessibility Considerations**

The principles discussed throughout the paper have profound implications for accessibility. Augmented text has the potential to significantly enhance the reading experience for users with disabilities by providing alternative ways to engage with content. However, the current study does not directly address how these technologies serve users with varying accessibility needs. By focusing the scope, the research underscores the need for specialised studies that specifically tackle accessibility in the context of augmented text, ensuring that these innovations are inclusive and beneficial for all users.

#### Ethical Considerations

Not applicable to this study, as it does not involve human participants or data collection that raises ethical concerns.

## Findings

### Summary of findings

1. **Context is king**: Across the findings, we see that doing nothing to help someone understand context always tests worse than doing something. This is an unsurprising result, but leads to finding #2, with its inconvenient implications.

2. **Authoring context is extremely difficult:** In a perfect world, every word, paragraph, or full paper would always provide context that doesn't take you out of flow. But in the real world, every one of these features requires development, testing, upcoming, and training. The key here is not to build cool features, but to understand the tradeoffs inherent in creating and publishing content.

3. **We need better metrics to rate ROI:** If a feature takes a year to develop, but only saves someone twenty seconds of time, it has poor ROI. The problem is that despite my efforts here, there's no standardised way to quantify if a feature that adds helpful content could be worth it.

4. **Some things are simply not possible without augmented text:** Many of the items compared boil down to a clear comparison between task completion across two flows. But some can't be compared because it's simply not possible to do without a change in technology. This is part of the tradeoff discussion.

5. **The possibilities are vast and contextual:** I've carved off a small handful of examples to compare here, but any publication of content could come up with new features. For example, imagine tools that help understand memes, or completely different tools designed for lawyers or doctors to understand their complex fields.

### Study #1: Word Lookup

#### Description
In the transition from traditional to digital mediums, the task of looking up a word has been vastly transformed. This study contrasts the process of finding a word's definition in a paperback book with the digital efficiency of iOS, Android, and Kindle platforms. The digital approach leverages rapid, in-context definition retrieval, thereby streamlining the reader's experience.

#### Summary of Findings
Traditional methods, while straightforward, proved to be slower and labeled a 'Fail' in the context of this study. The digital methods, especially iOS, demonstrated a significant reduction in time, with a 'Pass' status. However, when words were not directly defined, as with the nonsensical words in iOS and Android, the time and effort required spiked, resulting in a 'Fail'. Kindle's X-Ray feature maintained its efficiency with both real and nonsensical words, consistently passing.

### Study #2: Following References

#### Description
Navigating to additional resources is critical for in-depth understanding in both traditional reading and digital exploration. This study compares how readers follow references to other media in a traditional format versus using a digital hyperlink. The process's efficiency and intuitiveness are crucial for maintaining the reader's engagement and flow of reading.

#### Summary of Findings
Both traditional and digital methods passed the study's criteria, demonstrating that the process of following references has been effectively adapted to the digital age. The time taken was the same for both methods, showing that digital innovation has successfully matched the traditional efficiency while potentially offering a more integrated and seamless experience.

### Study #3: Footnotes

#### Description
Footnotes are essential for providing additional context and information without disrupting the main text flow. This study contrasts the traditional practice of flipping to the end of a book to read a footnote with the modern approach of popover footnotes in digital texts. The focus is on the ease and speed with which a reader can access this supplementary material.

#### Summary of Findings
Traditional footnotes involve a greater time investment and physical effort but have been found satisfactory in the study. Digital popover footnotes, on the other hand, significantly reduce the time to just a few seconds and provide an immediate, in-context understanding, thus passing the criteria with a notable improvement in efficiency.

### Study #4: Image Comparison

#### Description
The ability to compare images is vital for visual learning and analysis. This study examines the traditional method of comparing two images across physical pages versus the digital method using a before and after slider. The focus is on the effectiveness and efficiency of the comparison process.

#### Summary of Findings
Traditional methods of image comparison require more time and effort as users need to flip pages back and forth. The digital method provides a significant improvement in speed, reducing the time to just a few seconds with a streamlined user experience. Both methods received a 'Pass,' indicating satisfactory results, but the digital method shines in user efficiency.

### Study #5: Bookmarking

#### Description
Remembering where one left off in a reading session is crucial for a seamless reading experience. This study compares the traditional method of mentally noting or physically marking a page with the use of a digital last read indicator. The ease and reliability of resuming a reading session are evaluated.

#### Summary of Findings
The traditional method shows a higher effort from the reader's side, resulting in a 'Fail' for this study. In contrast, the digital last read indicator proves to be highly efficient, allowing users to quickly and effortlessly return to their last stopping point in the text, receiving a 'Pass'.


### Study #6: Reference Tracking

#### Description
In the digital age, managing multiple references efficiently is vital. This study evaluates the traditional method of remembering an old tab against the modern solution of reference labels. The focus is on the user's ability to maintain their train of thought and navigate between resources effectively.

#### Summary of Findings
The traditional method of recalling previous tabs proved to be inefficient, receiving a 'Fail' status. Meanwhile, the digital approach of using reference labels significantly improved navigation, allowing quick access to previously visited materials, which was reflected in a 'Pass' outcome.

### Study #7: Article Evolution

#### Description
This study contrasts traditional methods of observing article changes with the digital approach, highlighting the efficiency of tracking content updates over time.

#### Summary of Findings
Traditional methods failed to provide a swift recognition of article changes, while the digital 'Article Diff' tool significantly improved the speed and clarity of understanding updates.


### Study #8: Dynamic Content Interaction

#### Description
Evaluates traditional static reading against digital interactive elements, focusing on user engagement with dynamic content in articles.

#### Summary of Findings
The traditional approach failed to accommodate the dynamic interaction, while the digital method passed with ease, offering interactive number manipulation within the text.


### Study #9: Navigation History

#### Description
Compares the traditional method of retracing one's steps in a text with digital breadcrumbs for navigating through an academic text's browser history.

#### Summary of Findings
Traditional backtracking proved inefficient, while digital breadcrumbs provided a clear and quick path to previously visited sections, enhancing the navigation experience.

### Study #10: Summarization Tools

#### Description
Analyzes the effectiveness of summarising complex articles or concepts through traditional means versus digital summarization tools.

#### Summary of Findings
Traditional summarization lacked efficiency and consistency, while both hard-coded and AI-powered digital widgets succeeded in condensing content effectively.

## Discussion

### Context is king
This work has studied how much we can enhance the reading experience without compromising the essence of traditional reading. which implies that help is always better than no help in this context. It's a statement so obvious as to seem trite, but it will be the foundation we build our entire discussion and further works on, so it's worth stress testing it a bit before we proceed. We need to confirm: is more help always better?

To illustrate, let's imagine you find a book in a store off Cuba Street in Wellington, New Zealand. You flip open the first pages and spot this introductory passage:

> There are two questions which I would like to begin with. First, what kind of critical and inventive thinking is required to take the various movements in software forward into those areas which are necessary if software oIigopoIies are to be undermined? But further, how are we to develop the capacity for unleashing the unexpected upon software and the certainties which form it?

Imagine you understand the passage perfectly, and need no assistance understanding any of the vocabulary or concepts. If that were the case, you might be puzzled by a second paragraph directly after the first one, perhaps saying something like this:

>*(In case you didn't understand the prior passage, it's asking two things: First, what smart ideas do we need to make software better and challenge big companies? Second, how can we make software more surprising?)*

Or what if there was a follow-up paragraph in another language, such as:

>*(In case you wanted to read the above passage in Maori: E rua nga pātai e hiahia ana ahau ki te tīmata. Tuatahi, he aha te momo whakaaro takenui me te waihanga e hiahiatia ana hei tango i ngā momo nekeneke i roto i ngā pūmanawa whakamua ki aua wāhi e hiahiatia ana mēnā me whakararuraru ngā pūmanawa oIigopoIies? Engari anō, me pēhea tātau e whakawhanake ai i te kaha mō te tuku i te ohorere ki ngā pūmanawa me ngā mea e hanga ana?)*

If you didn't ask for a simplified English or a Maori version, the additional help wouldn't seem like help at all. It would instead feel like clutter or an annoyance getting in the way of your main goal, reading the text. This is a clear demonstration of why help, when not asked for, might not be helpful at all.

But what about someone in the opposite situation? What if they read the above passage and didn't know what the word "oIigopoIies" means? What then? That's where help is valuable. Maybe they ask their friend, who accurately defines what the word means, but the meaning of the text still escapes comprehension. What is a "software oIigopoIy?" Why should they be undermined? Perhaps they do a search on Google for "[software oligopolies](https://www.google.com/search?q=software+oIigopoIies)," where as of the writing of this text in February 2024, Google returns no valuable context, believing instead that I meant to search for "software logos" or "software tipos."

Maybe they buy the book to ask their professor about it the next day, who can accurately explain the word, the implication behind "software oIigopoIies," the main thrust of the argument, and why the author might be arguing for them to be undermined. But that's less likely than what most people do: we notice words or concepts that we don't understand, but we don't take special action to learn them. We might be curious, but traditional books don't provide the tools to quickly learn, so we abandon the task.

What if a person could touch on a word in any physical book and learn the definition right away? It wouldn't require asking the friend, or Google, or their professor. It would be faster, tailored to the text, and even tailored to the era. For example, the person could tap the word "software oIigopoIies" and the definition could say "these days, this might be written as 'big tech', like Apple, Meta, Google, and Microsoft." Or perhaps the reader is deeply interested in anticompetitive practices from Microsoft, so a smart and customised definition software could report something like "Microsoft could be described as a "software oIigopoIy" as a way to reach the reader more directly. This is not possible today with physical books, but ebooks and other reader software can.

In the findings, looking up a word on iOS resulted in a LTM sequence of MPTMTT, which is estimated to take 4.7 seconds. In contrast, looking up a word in a physical copy of a book isn't possible, returning an LTM sequence of MHTM[PTK]T, an estimated time of 16.4 seconds, (representing the fastest estimated time someone can quit one app and search for a definition in a dictionary app), and a failing task. This neatly demonstrates the difference between not being able to access answers or context without external help versus having context as part of the reading experience.

Now we'll try a curveball. iOS does a good job defining words when they're in the English language, but fails when it doesn't recognise a word. For example, imagine a reader is enjoying the novel Dune, and they long-press the capitalised word Adept, a term that has special meaning in the Dune literature. iOS will return the English language translation for the word, despite the capitalisation, rather than the actual definition someone is looking for when reading Dune. Worse still is what happens when you try to define a word that doesn't exist at all. If our reader attempts to look up the word Auqaf, they'll be told by iOS that the word isn't available and instead show the definition of the word "Aqua." These failures result in LTM sequences of MPTM[TPTKMPTRT]T, taking 16.95 seconds, conservatively. It could be argued that the additional confusion of expecting a result and getting the wrong one would add more cognitive load and time than simply not having the feature at all.

As a contrast, Amazon's Kindle has a feature called X-Ray that doesn't just perform a simple dictionary search on a word, it attempts to pull other context into the reading experience. Looking up the same Dune words on Kindle result in LTM sequences of MPTT and a time of 2.85 seconds, the fastest of an option by far. When reading, context is king. Any software that can provide useful context is better than software that can't, provided that it only is offered when requested. And amongst different software options that can provide differing levels of quality and speed, the right answers delivered faster will always be better than ones with bad data or that are delivered slowly.

### Creating and socialising new ideas is extremely difficult

In the findings chart, I established a column for "developer effort" with only two options, green arrow up meaning "no big deal" or a red arrow down that means "kind of a big deal." This metric is comically, insultingly vague. The fact that everything from chatGPT's codebase to creating a simple tooltip both fall into the same category shows that this metric is meant for comparative purposes, not any kind of objective measure of difficulty. Put another way, I'm not attempting to say how hard something else, just that it's harder than the traditional way of doing it.

As a tangible example, "comparing two images across two pages" is a common action when seeing two images presented side by side, and requires no special effort from the author or developer. Therefore, it gets a green arrow pointing up. On the other hand, creating a Before and After slider isn't particularly difficult because it's such a common component. But it does take some effort to wire up, so it gets a red arrow pointing down. So these measurements provide a good comparative analysis, whereas a full accounting of exactly how complex each task may be is beyond the scope of this research.

But this metric goes beyond simple coding difficulty. We also need to factor in the complexity of a fragmenting media ecosystem, and the fact that no single entity owns the right to publish ideas on the internet. To illustrate this, let's say you wanted to argue that the Article Diff feature should exist for all media organisations. If you don't work at one, you probably won't get very far. But even if you are the CTO of the New York Times, and you successfully ship the feature to the New York Times audience, you have no control over what the Washington Post does, or the New Zealand Herald. Others may adopt your idea, but it's not really up to you. This means that no matter how good any of the ideas are that I've presented, no matter how much faster or better they are in objective ways, their reach is out of the control of any one entity. And that's a problem for improving the overall experience of reading text.

In doing my literature review, I noticed a lot of research talking about ways to make concepts such as Explorable Explanations more mainstream. A common suggestion was to make new programming languages or paradigms to help more people create helpful content to help people learn more, more effectively. But even with the best new programming language in the world, with the best tutorials, the best outreach content, the most motivated team, and the money to pay for it, it's still much harder to write code than write copy. Some organisations such as Pudding.cool and The New York Times have been able to fund this kind of work, but it's still a minority of all content. It's the opinion of the author that this is appropriate. Most reading should be reading, and even when teaching aids and illustrations are introduced, it should be the bare minimum required to get the main point across, and always something the user requests, rather than something that's pushed on them.

I want to put a very clear line in the sand here: despite all the advantages of augmented text, and in helping people add context to the content they're reading, it's still a tremendous technical challenge that is not easy to address. It won't be addressed or fixed by better programming languages or better ideas. Success of these ideas will emerge slowly and organically, in the marketplace of ideas. If a large organisation such as Wordpress decides to embrace some examples of Augmented Text, then its competitors decide to react in order to stay competitive, the ideas will spread. Slowly, and over time, some ideas might become popular enough in the mainstream. But it will take that, and nothing less than that, not a better programming language. 

### We need better metrics to rate ROI
My research struggled to come up with a conceptual framework to help understand which features could benefit from improvements, and by how much. If we could quantify actions easily, like knowing that following any hyperlink took exactly 3 seconds, or researching a footnote always took 7 seconds, I'd have a more objective measure to rely on. Instead, my methodology needed to rely on relative measures. This works well when comparing traditional to traditional approaches, but doesn't work as well when determining the overall benefit of a new feature.

I'd propose a new heuristic for determining the potential success of a new approach: estimate the total number of developer hours a feature might take, and compare it to how many hours we think it will save the audience. For example, if the "Interactive Numbers" feature only requires 8 developer hours to create and implement on a site, whereas one million people would use the feature and each would save 2 minutes, that means the effort took 8 hours but saved 33,333 hours, for an ROI of 4167:1.

On the other hand, imagine if "Summarise Widget (Hard-coded)" takes a team of 12 3 months to implement, but the overall user base it's serving means that only 1000 people will see it and get 5 minutes of value each. That means the team would spend 5,760 hours building a feature that users would get 83 hours of use out of each week, for a ratio of .0145:1. At this rate, it would take 69.12 weeks for the feature to break even. On one hand, that's more than a year for the ROI to pay off. On the other hand, if that year positions your media organisation favourably, and you become known as a site that doesn't just deliver news but helps you comprehend it, maybe that's an investment worth making. But either way, it's important to quantify these ideas in a way that helps determine if they're worth it or not, in as objective a way as possible. Even the best feature in the world, which would help literally everyone who saw it, needs to justify its investment. If only 100 people will see it, but it takes a million dollars to build it, that at least needs to be built into the ROI in some tangible way.

### Some things are simply not possible without augmented text
In the digital age, the evolution of text from static to dynamic through augmentation has opened new horizons that were previously unimaginable. Traditional text, while a cornerstone of knowledge transfer and communication for centuries, inherently possesses limitations that restrict the depth of interaction and engagement. This is where the notion that "Some Things Are Simply Not Possible Without Augmented Text" comes into play, underscoring a pivotal shift in how we perceive and interact with written content.

Augmented text transcends these limitations by embedding interactivity, multimedia, and context-aware features directly within the text, enabling a multifaceted reading experience that traditional mediums cannot offer. This enhancement is not merely about adding novelty to reading; it's about fundamentally expanding the capabilities of text to inform, educate, and engage.

One of the most significant advantages of augmented text is its ability to bridge comprehension gaps in real-time. Consider complex scientific papers or historical documents laden with specialised terminology. Without augmentation, readers might find themselves disengaged, lost in jargon that feels inaccessible. Augmented text, however, can instantly provide definitions, explanations, or visual aids at the point of need, seamlessly integrated into the reading experience. This immediacy transforms the act of reading from a passive to an interactive journey, where understanding is not just facilitated but enriched.

The capacity for personalization is another realm where augmented text shines. Traditional texts offer a one-size-fits-all approach that can't adapt to the diverse needs and preferences of its audience. Augmented text, conversely, can tailor the reading experience to individual users, accommodating different learning styles, languages, and even accessibility needs. This personalization extends the reach of text, making information not just available but accessible to a broader audience, including those with disabilities who might find traditional text formats challenging.

Augmented text also serves as a platform for creativity and exploration, enabling authors and educators to embed interactive elements, simulations, and exploratory tools within the text. This capability transforms the reading experience into an interactive journey, where readers can simulate experiments, visualise data dynamically, or explore scenarios within the narrative. Such interactivity invites readers to engage deeply with the content, fostering a more profound understanding and retention of information.

Moreover, augmented text overcomes the physical and digital boundaries that confine traditional text. Geographic and temporal constraints, which once limited the dissemination and relevance of information, are rendered moot. Augmented text can incorporate real-time data, connect readers across the globe through collaborative annotations, or update content to reflect the latest developments, ensuring the information remains relevant and timely.

Despite its potential, the widespread adoption of augmented text faces significant challenges, particularly in implementation. Developing sophisticated augmented text systems requires considerable investment in technology, design, and content creation. Moreover, the technological infrastructure to support such features must be universally accessible, posing a challenge in ensuring equitable access to the benefits of augmented text.

Looking ahead, the possibilities of augmented text are vast and largely untapped. As technology advances, we can anticipate even more innovative forms of augmentation, from augmented reality overlays that bring text to life in our physical environment to AI-driven personal assistants that provide contextual insights and support. These advancements promise to further dissolve the barriers between readers and the knowledge they seek, ushering in a new era of text that is not just read but experienced.

### The possibilities are vast and contextual
The exploration of augmented text thus far has only scratched the surface of its potential. By examining a select few examples, we've begun to understand its impact. However, the true breadth of possibilities it holds is as boundless as the diversity of content that exists in our world. Augmented text is not merely a tool for enhancing traditional reading experiences; it's a gateway to uncharted territories of knowledge and interaction.

Consider the realm of memes, a ubiquitous form of digital communication that blends humor, culture, and commentary. Augmented text could offer tools to dissect and understand the layers of meaning within a meme, contextualising its references and nuances for those not in the know. Such tools could transform fleeting moments of entertainment into rich, educational experiences, broadening our understanding of digital culture.

The potential applications extend far beyond popular culture, reaching into the specialised and complex worlds of various professions. For lawyers, augmented text could revolutionise the way legal documents are interacted with, offering real-time annotations, precedent references, and legal interpretations at the touch of a word. This could demystify legal language, making it more accessible to practitioners and the public alike.

In the medical field, doctors and students could benefit from augmented textbooks and journals that offer interactive diagrams, patient case studies, and the latest research findings embedded directly within the text. This could facilitate a deeper understanding of medical conditions and treatments, enhancing the learning process and ultimately improving patient care.

The possibilities are indeed vast and contextual, limited only by our imagination and the technological advancements that continue to unfold. As augmented text evolves, it promises to reshape not only how we consume information but also how we interact with the world around us. It encourages a future where knowledge is more accessible, education is more interactive, and our capacity for understanding and innovation is boundless.

This vision of the future, powered by augmented text, is not just an aspiration but a call to action for creators, developers, and thinkers. It challenges us to envision and build new ways of sharing and discovering knowledge, to transcend the limitations of traditional text, and to embrace the vast, untapped potential that lies within augmented text.

As we embrace the digital age's challenges and opportunities, research in augmented text becomes not just an academic pursuit but a societal imperative. It's a journey towards a more enlightened, accessible, and connected world through the power of text, transformed.

## Conclusion

#### Summary of Key Findings

####  #1: Context is king

The research findings underscore a fundamental truth when comprehending text: context matters. This principle manifests itself consistently across various studies, clearly illustrating that any assistance in providing context invariably outperforms the lack thereof. While this revelation hardly surprises, it demands a closer examination, for it carries significant implications for the future of reading and comprehension in a digital age.

In an era where multimedia has become increasingly segmented—audio, video, and text typically confined within their own distinct silos—the augmentation of text with contextual aids stands as a testament to the unique capabilities of software. Unlike traditional media, which may require a reader to seek context externally, augmented text can deliver nuanced layers of understanding directly within the reading flow. The integration of hyperlinks was merely the inception of this evolutionary journey; the potential of software to enrich text with context is a continuous, expanding frontier.

Consider the traditional reading experience: static and self-contained. In contrast, augmented text is dynamic, capable of providing definitions, background information, and related concepts at the reader's behest. This is not merely an enhancement of the reading experience—it is a transformation. Augmented text, powered by software, bridges the gap between the reader's curiosity and the knowledge they seek, often instantaneously.

The implications for educational and informational content are profound. Augmented text offers a medium where flow and comprehension are no longer at odds. Readers need not be jolted from their engagement to seek clarification. Instead, explanations, visual aids, and interactive elements coalesce within the text, fostering a seamless and enriched learning environment. This is particularly salient in the digital landscape, where the abundance of information can easily overwhelm. Augmented text, with its contextual prowess, acts as a lighthouse guiding readers through a sea of data.

However, this capability comes with its own set of challenges. The creation of augmented text that effectively delivers context without disrupting flow requires a delicate balance. It necessitates thoughtful design, a deep understanding of user needs, and, crucially, a recognition of the trade-offs involved. Each feature, each interactive element introduced into the text, must be justified—not just in terms of its development cost but, more importantly, in its contribution to the reader's understanding and engagement.

Therefore, while the expansion of context within augmented text opens new frontiers for comprehension and engagement, it also calls for a responsible and strategic approach. The goal is not to dazzle with technology for its own sake but to enhance the essence of reading in ways that are both meaningful and respectful of the reader's journey through the text. This expanded view of context in augmented text serves as a foundational principle that will drive both current and future explorations in the field.

#### #2: Authoring context is extremely difficult

The journey from ideation to implementation of features that provide context within text is fraught with complexity. While the ideal scenario envisions a seamless provision of contextual information, the reality is that each feature bears the weight of development, testing, upkeep, and user education.

The aspiration to offer readers a layered, nuanced understanding of text is compelling. Imagine a world where every word or concept is a portal to deeper insight, where paragraphs serve not only to convey information but also to anticipate and answer questions, where entire papers adapt to the reader’s context and knowledge level, offering a bespoke reading experience. However, this world demands a significant commitment of resources.

Development effort is a critical consideration; it involves not only the initial creation of features but also their integration into existing systems. Testing ensures that the augmentations add value without disrupting the user's flow, a balance that is delicate and often elusive. The upkeep is a commitment to the longevity and relevance of these features, necessitating ongoing support and adaptation to evolving content and user needs.

Training users to utilise these features effectively is another layer of complexity. It is not enough to build; one must also educate. Users need to understand not only the existence of these tools but also their application to realise their benefits fully.

Each feature is a tradeoff—a calculation of the value added against the investment required. The development of cool, innovative features is a commendable pursuit. Still, it is the understanding of these tradeoffs that truly shapes the landscape of contextual augmentation. This is the intricate tapestry of augmented text, where each thread of development, testing, upkeep, and education must be woven with intention and care to enrich the reading experience without overwhelming it.

In this nuanced dance between technology and text, we seek to craft an experience that respects the reader's journey through content, enhancing without distracting, clarifying without cluttering. It is a pursuit that balances the allure of innovation with the pragmatism of execution, a pursuit that will continue to evolve as we push the boundaries of what it means to read and comprehend in an increasingly digital world.

#### #3: We need better metrics to rate ROI

To address the imperative need for better metrics to evaluate the Return on Investment (ROI) of augmented text features, this research highlights a critical gap in our current evaluation methodologies. Traditional ROI assessments, often rooted in quantitative metrics like time savings, cost reductions, and user activity levels, fail to capture the full spectrum of benefits that augmented text delivers. These include, but are not limited to, enhanced comprehension, increased engagement, improved accessibility, and a more personalised reading experience. The intrinsic value of these qualitative benefits poses a significant challenge: how can we measure and balance these against the tangible costs of development and maintenance?

One promising avenue is the creation of a multidimensional evaluation framework that goes beyond conventional financial metrics. This framework would integrate a variety of factors including user satisfaction, learning outcomes, engagement levels, and behavioural changes, alongside the direct costs associated with development, implementation, and ongoing support of augmented text features. The aim of such a holistic approach is not merely to quantify the unquantifiable but to provide a more nuanced understanding of how augmented text impacts the reader's experience and knowledge acquisition.

To operationalise this framework, stakeholders could employ a combination of surveys, user analytics, and A/B testing to gather data on user satisfaction and learning outcomes. For instance, surveys could measure the perceived value and usability of augmented text features, while analytics could track engagement patterns and how they correlate with the use of specific features. A/B testing could compare the effectiveness of augmented texts against traditional texts in achieving specific learning outcomes. Together, these data points would offer a comprehensive picture of the augmented text's value proposition.

Moreover, incorporating development and maintenance costs into this evaluation requires a transparent accounting of the resources invested in creating and sustaining augmented text features. This includes not just the initial development costs but also the ongoing expenses related to content updates, platform compatibility, and user support. By comparing these costs against the measured benefits, stakeholders can make more informed decisions about which features offer the best ROI.


### 3. We need better metrics to rate ROI

The development of standardised metrics for evaluating ROI in augmented text is crucial for guiding future innovations in this space. By clearly delineating the areas where technology can have the most significant impact, this framework encourages targeted investments in features that promise to enhance the reading experience most effectively. It's not just about the financial return; it's about fostering a culture of innovation that prioritizes meaningful enhancements to the reading experience.

Such a standardised approach also has the potential to democratise the development of augmented text features. By providing clear benchmarks for success, smaller publishers and independent creators can better assess the viability of investing in augmented text technologies. This could lead to a more diverse ecosystem of augmented text offerings, enriching the landscape of digital reading experiences available to users.

In summary, developing better metrics for evaluating the ROI of augmented text features is a complex but necessary endeavour. By adopting a multidimensional evaluation framework, stakeholders can gain a deeper understanding of the true value of augmented text, beyond the superficial metrics of cost and user numbers. This holistic approach not only facilitates more informed decision-making but also drives innovation by highlighting the transformative potential of augmented text in enhancing the reading experience. As we move forward, the challenge will be to refine these metrics, ensuring they remain adaptable and relevant in the face of rapidly evolving digital reading technologies.

### 4: Some things are not possible without augmented text
Augmented text emerges not merely as an enhancement to the traditional reading experience but as an essential tool for unlocking levels of interaction and comprehension previously unattainable. This research has vividly illustrated that certain enhancements and understandings within the reading process are intrinsically linked to the capabilities provided by augmented text. Through the integration of technology, augmented text transcends traditional textual limitations, enabling instant access to definitions, annotations, and contextual data, thus transforming reading from a static to a dynamic, interactive experience. This shift is not merely an incremental improvement but a fundamental expansion of what text can convey and how readers engage with it.

The indispensability of augmented text is particularly evident when considering the complex cognitive processes involved in reading and comprehension. Traditional texts, while serving as the backbone of knowledge dissemination for centuries, inherently lack the capacity to adapt to the reader’s needs in real-time. In contrast, augmented text can provide tailored insights, elaborate on concepts with multimedia support, and offer interactive elements that adapt to the individual reader’s context and comprehension level. This capacity for personalization is pivotal, especially in educational contexts where the diversity of learning styles and needs is increasingly recognized.

Moreover, augmented text holds the potential to democratise access to information. By embedding support mechanisms directly into the text, readers from various backgrounds and with different levels of prior knowledge can engage with complex material more effectively. This is particularly relevant in fields laden with specialised terminology or concepts, where augmented text can serve as a bridge, bringing the reader closer to the expert’s understanding.

The technological advancements that enable augmented text also invite us to reconsider the boundaries of the reading experience. For instance, augmented reality (AR) applications can overlay additional information directly onto physical texts, blending the tactile experience of reading a traditional book with the interactive benefits of digital technology. Similarly, machine learning algorithms can analyze a reader's interaction patterns with augmented texts to provide even more personalised and contextually relevant content, further enhancing the reading experience.

The challenge, however, lies in the implementation and ethical considerations of such technologies. The development of augmented text features requires a careful balance between providing valuable enhancements and ensuring user privacy and data security. Moreover, the risk of information overload is real; thus, features must be designed to enhance rather than detract from the reading experience. This necessitates a user-centered design approach, where the needs and preferences of the reader guide the development of augmented text features.

In conclusion, the role of augmented text in modern reading experiences is undeniably indispensable. By offering capabilities that extend far beyond the possibilities of traditional text, augmented text not only enhances comprehension and engagement but also paves the way for a more inclusive and accessible approach to reading. As we move forward, the focus should be on harnessing these capabilities in a responsible and user-centered manner, ensuring that augmented text continues to serve as a powerful tool for knowledge dissemination and exploration in the digital age.

Augmented text's versatility allows for the creation of specialised tools that can profoundly impact various professional fields, including law, medicine, education, and beyond. For legal professionals, augmented text could simplify the navigation of complex legal documents, providing instant access to case law, definitions, and interpretations that enhance understanding and efficiency. Similarly, in the medical field, augmented texts could transform medical education and patient care by embedding interactive 3D models, real-time data, and case studies directly within medical literature, offering an immersive learning experience and quick access to critical information.

The educational sector stands to benefit significantly from augmented text technologies. Tailored learning experiences can be created to accommodate diverse learning styles, with text that adapts in real-time to the reader's comprehension level and interests. Augmented text can also bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, offering students interactive simulations, historical context, and multilingual translations that enrich the learning experience.

Moreover, the potential of augmented text extends into everyday life, enhancing how we interact with the world around us. Imagine tools embedded within digital publications that allow readers to deeply understand and engage with current events, cultural phenomena, or even the complexities of memes, providing layers of context, background, and analysis. Such tools could democratise knowledge, making complex topics accessible and engaging to a broader audience.

The implications for content creators are equally profound. Augmented text offers new dimensions of creativity and expression, enabling authors to embed multimedia elements, interactive features, and personalised content paths within their works. This could usher in a new era of storytelling, where narratives are not just read but experienced, with readers actively participating in the story through choices, interactions, and exploration.

However, realising the full potential of augmented text requires overcoming significant challenges, including technological barriers, user accessibility, and ethical considerations. Developing intuitive, user-friendly augmented text features that respect privacy and data security will be crucial for widespread adoption. Additionally, ensuring these technologies are accessible to all, regardless of socioeconomic status or disability, is essential for maximising their impact.

As we stand on the brink of this new frontier in reading and information interaction, it is clear that the possibilities offered by augmented text are as vast as they are contextual. By continuing to explore and innovate within this space, we can unlock new ways of learning, understanding, and connecting with the world around us. The journey into augmented text is just beginning, and its potential to transform our relationship with text is limited only by our imagination and willingness to embrace the unknown.
