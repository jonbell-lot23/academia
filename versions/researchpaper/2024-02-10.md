# Augmented Text


## Abstract
Would it be appropriate for a research paper to require watching a video before reading the text? The answer was just as clear fifty years ago as it is today: no, formal research papers should not rely on anything that the printed page cannot natively support. Text, diagrams, and images are first class media types, but everything else is offloaded to a footnote or hyperlink. Words have always been the main event, and any supporting media is typically seen as a quirky distraction, apart from the core of the content.

When you communicate with an assumption that most people will not chase down your references or watch your supporting media, something is lost. Simple text can only go so far, and the future of reading for education is not more text with more footnotes linking to more external content that's doomed to be overlooked or ignored. Interactive visualisations, explainer simulations, videos, and even memes all have a role to play in the future of comprehension of text, and this will only increase in the future.

We've seen a lot of exploration in this space, and many false starts. As limiting as text-based reading might be, it's still the gold standard. No one is looking to convert all literature into YouTube summaries, Explorable Explanations, simulations, and games. The goal is not to remove the written word with unwieldy and frustrating software experiences, but to augment it seamlessly, concisely, and with great care.  Therefore, the central question this work will attempt to answer is "How much can software improve the reading experience while still retaining the essence of the reading experience?"

It's a difficult balance to get right, and what this paper will explore—how augmented text takes the timeless act of reading and allows to be be more helpful and contextual for its audience. Just as a chameleon changes its colours to suit its environment, augmented text reshapes itself to suit the reader's needs. It's reading, reimagined for a world where the written word is no longer static, but dynamic; not fixed, but fluid; not one-size-fits-all, but personalised. 



## Introduction

### In the beginning, there were words

The essence of storytelling has never changed. From ancient tales shared around the fire to today's digital narratives, the objective has always been to inform, entertain, persuade, and connect on as wide a scale as possible. Just as ancient storytellers might have held their listeners spellbound with memorable narratives around a campfire, so do modern podcasts, TED Talks, and Netflix shows. Cuneiform, the printing press, and the internet are extraordinarily different technologies and implementations yet are aiming towards the same noble goal: reaching as many people as possible to communicate as effectively as possible.

There are parallels between old and new, because storytelling is core to the human experience. While tools and technologies evolve, the fundamental human need for communication remains. Augmented text, with its interactive and multimedia capabilities, is simply the latest iteration in this continuum. It takes the essence of what has always been important in communication — clarity, impact, engagement, and accessibility — and builds upon it with the benefits afforded by modern technology that we're missing out on by not re-evaluating the experience of reading and improving it to keep pace with how people read in modern contexts.

By weaving this story arc through this research, we'll show that augmented text is not an faddish outlier in the history of communication but the next step of a natural progression. It embodies the same principles that have driven the development of communication methods for millennia, now accelerated by digital interactivity and the global reach of the internet. This perspective will serve to situate augmented text within a broader historical context, demonstrating its relevance and potential as the next step in the ongoing journey of human expression. We'll also illustrate why a next step is necessary, and why multimedia has plateaued since the invention of the hyperlink.

### Let's get specific

When our ancient ancestors narrated stories around the fire, they were not only preserving their heritage but also embedding the roots of language as we understand it today. This fundamental drive for communication echoes Noam Chomsky's influential linguistic theories. Chomsky (1957) introduced the groundbreaking concept of a "universal grammar," proposing that certain aspects of linguistic structure are innate to the human mind and thus universally present in all languages. This perspective, which he further developed in his later works (Chomsky, 1965), implies that the capacity for language is biologically hardwired rather than acquired. Chomsky's theories, as expounded in his subsequent works (Chomsky, 2005), suggest that this innate language facility has played a critical role in human evolution, shaping our ability to communicate complex ideas and narratives. The transition from oral tradition to written language, a pivotal moment in the history of human communication, can be viewed through the lens of Chomsky's linguistic framework. Lewandowska-Tomaszczyk (2016) further expounded on the evolution and impact of Chomsky's generative grammar, underscoring its significance in the progression from oral storytelling to the written word. These theoretical insights provide a deeper understanding of the intrinsic nature of language and its role in human civilisation.

Around 3400 BC, Sumerian scribes in Mesopotamia laid the groundwork for the first known form of written communication, called cuneiform. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform) This intricate system of wedge-shaped marks pressed into clay tablets allowed the recording of inventories, laws, and narratives, marking a significant improvement around how humankind preserved and disseminated knowledge. This allowed information to outlive its author and be shared with audiences for the first time. The impact of this technology cannot be overstated; it's easily on par with the invention of the wheel and fire, and was the precursor, however humbly, to the contemporary reading experience we experience today.

Tablets were a good start, but they were hardly portable. This lead to the invention of paper by the Chinese around the 1st century AD. Then the printing press, invented by Johannes Gutenberg in 15th century Europe, took the revolution a step further by making the process easier and widely available. Knowledge was no longer the exclusive domain of the affluent and the clergy; it was accessible to anyone who could read. (Kross et al., 2021) Like cuneiform and paper before it, this technology permanently changed the way humanity communicated, and the resulting impact, again, cannot be overstated. As Albertin et al. (2018) explore, the forces unleashed when information became more portable weren't all good or all bad. They simply accelerated many good and bad aspects of society, an insight that seems familiar to us today with all the promise and peril of the modern internet.

The evolution from spoken word to written, then from expensive to cheap, set up the desktop and internet revolutions of the late 20th century, followed by the explosion of smartphone usage, which made communication as cheap and plentiful as it’s ever been. Today, the combination of the internet and mobile means we've never had more content, in reach of as many people (both in absolute terms and per capita), being produced by more people. Yet the technology we're using to communicate multimedia concepts has stayed surprisingly static for the last 50 years. With the exception of the popularisation of the hyperlink in the 1990s, there has been very little technological innovation that has changed the way we consume the written word.

We used to speak around campfires, whereas now we record podcasts, shoot Instagram stories, and record video chats. But at their heart, it's all just verbal communication. We used to write stories, first on caves, then on tablets, then on paper. Now we've added websites, status updates, ebooks, and group texts, but and their heart, they're all just textual communication. You can tell the same stories about music and video; music has always been music, even as the technology powering them changes and evolves. Movies have always been movies, whether black and white, full colour, 3d, or VR. And the consumption experiences for all have stayed largely the same as well. We still watch movies and plays in theatres, we still listen to music on our own or as part of a group concert. We still watch people tell stories, whether around a campfire, on YouTube, or at a stand-up comedy show. The more things change, the more they stay the same.

By perceiving modern digital formats like the Kindle, YouTube videos, or online news stories as mere digital versions of their traditional counterparts, we risk missing opportunities for more impactful communication. This oversight is akin to the initial limitations of early websites and TV shows, which merely replicated existing physical and broadcast formats. Neil Postman, in his seminal work 'Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business,' echoes this concern, critiquing the tendency to view new media forms as mere extensions of the old without acknowledging their unique characteristics and implications (Citation: Postman, 1985). He warns against the uncritical acceptance of these forms, urging a more nuanced examination of how they shape communication and discourse. This phenomenon highlights the importance of seamlessly blending new technologies with traditional media. Just as television evolved from the simplicity of 'I Love Lucy' to the complexity of 'Game of Thrones,' our understanding and use of digital media must also progress. While the essence of storytelling remains constant, the methods of delivery should be enhanced, aiming for both conciseness and seamless integration with emerging technologies.

The realm of interactive media and multimedia, while often static in its approach, contrasts sharply with the dynamic nature of games, which have consistently been a fertile ground for interactive innovations. This distinction is particularly evident in the work of Barr, who explores the unique aspects of human-computer interaction within video games. In his research, Barr (Citation: 2008) emphasises that unlike traditional software, video games are played rather than used, necessitating a different approach to understanding interaction—one that considers 'play' as a central component. His analysis of how players' beliefs and values about preferable conduct influence their interaction with games sheds light on the multi-layered complexity of gaming as a form of human-computer interaction. This perspective is crucial for comprehending the interactive depth of games and their potential for innovation in the broader multimedia landscape, and why it far exceeds the narrow scope of what a reading experience demands.

This raises some crucial questions: Can elements from gaming be integrated seamlessly with traditional communication forms in a way that enhances rather than complicates the simple act of reading and the plain goal of communicating clearly? Does "play" automatically cause text to move from the realm of reading and into something more cognitively heavy, and therefore less effective as text? The answers are nuanced, and this exploration will delve into how interactive elements can be incorporated concisely and seamlessly into augmented text. Our aim is to explore how these interactive components can enrich the storytelling experience without overwhelming the core message, and therefore adhering to the principles of augmented text.

  

# The Limitations of Contemporary Multimedia

  

### A Failure of Imagination

  

To understand how contemporary multimedia is created, imagine writing a blog post in a large media organisation. What forms of media would be in your multimedia toolkit?

  

- Text input

- Links

- Images

- Video

  

And that's it. If you want to add something as simple as a gallery or slideshow of photos, you require a special widget or component. In most cases, this request would require special knowledge from someone with the right experience to offer it. This is reminiscent of how early versions of the bible were only decipherable by highly educated people in the church, requiring average people to ask for help. (Citation: Bible Gateway, n.d.) What if you want to show a comparison between two images, perhaps to show a before and after image of the effects of hurricane? Again, you'd be out of luck without someone coding the component for you. Or what if you wanted to provide some light interactivity to help explain a complex concept? Not possible unless you can explain it in text, images, or maybe a video. It's hard to argue that "text, sometimes with an image embedded in it," really counts as interactive multimedia. It's pretty close to reading a magazine or newspaper from 100 years ago, the only difference being that it's delivered over the internet, to a screen, with hyperlinks, and sometimes with an embedded video.

  

On the other end of the interactive spectrum, we have video games, a media type categorisation so broad as to be meaningless. One could make the argument that the subject matter addressed by games is even more vast than the entire collected works of books in all of human recorded history. The difference is in interactivity. Romeo and Juliet is just another love story, but if you played Romeo and Juliet as a simulated experience, you could drive the story however you want. By definition, a book will have one ending. By definition, many games will be expected to have multiple endings, multiple paths to get there, and a sense of autonomy that makes each experience necessarily different from anyone else's experience. Citizen Kane is an epic movie about a legendary character. A single interactive product like World of Warcraft aims to provide multiple storylines just as epic and personalised as Citizen Kane to the more than 100 million people who have played it. In terms of sheer quantity, there's no contest which experience provides a wider range of experiences.

  

But quantity isn't the only metric. When you're reading a news article, you're not seeking a game of pinball. When you're playing Minecraft, you're not seeking to read a 300 page book of lore. As demonstrated in Grain of the Web (Citation: Chimero, 2015) and referred to frequently in this thesis, effective communication with text and media requires using the right tool for the job. Just as you wouldn't use a screwdriver to hammer a nail, or rely on interpretative dance to critique some architecture, an essay doesn't work as well as a series of images. A comic wouldn’t work as well described orally. A painting wasn’t meant to be a video. There is a “grain” to each media type that guides authors towards how to best use them, and if you go against the grain, they are less effective. The key to successful design and communication is to work within the space. I propose that multimedia artists have gotten complacent, where we have simple CMS systems for writing with text + images and overly complex game authoring environments for anything more complex than text. There's a vast space in between those extremes that warrants a closer look. To date, the closest word most people have used to describe this space is "simulation."

  

Simulations live between full-fledged games and traditional written content. They provide a bridge between the static and the interactive, allowing users to manipulate variables and observe the outcomes. This makes simulations particularly effective for demonstrating complex systems or processes that would be difficult to explain with text or images alone. For example, in the context of climate science, a simulation could allow users to increase or decrease greenhouse gas emissions and observe the effects on global temperature, sea level, and more. The interactivity of simulations supports active learning, as users can explore the system or process at their own pace, experimenting with different scenarios and seeing the results. This helps users to understand not just what happens, but why it happens, deepening their understanding and knowledge retention. This is not a new field, but it's one that's been poorly defined and advocated for for many years. The closest we've come in the popular imagination is when Bret Victor identified this spectrum of communication and coined the term “Explorable Explanations” to describe products that live in the middle of the two extremes: written content that uses interactive components to communicate concepts more effectively. (Citation: Victor, 2011) That's where we'll be focusing next.

  

### “Explorable Explanations” and “Active Essays”

  

Bret Victor introduced the concept of Explorable Explanations to offer a new way of presenting and interacting with text. The core idea is to transform text from mere information to be consumed into an "environment to think in." This was envisioned as an umbrella project with the goal of encouraging truly active reading. To make abstract concepts more concrete, Victor proposed the development of reactive documents that allow readers to manipulate authors' assumptions and see the consequences, explorable examples that make abstract concepts concrete, and contextual information that allows readers to learn related material just-in-time and cross-check the author's claims.

  

Victor's ideas, however, were not completely new. Computing pioneer Alan Kay had previously discussed the concept of active essays which blended computer-based simulations with explanatory text. (Citation: Kay, 2003) This was a part of his vision for transforming the computer into a new kind of medium for creative thought, combining the dynamic and interactive nature of the computer with the narrative and argumentative strength of the essay.

  

These ideas have led to a surge of explorations in the field. Notably, Nicky Case has been instrumental in bringing these ideas to life. One notable example is "Parable of the Polygons", a web-based interactive simulation game that visually demonstrates how small individual biases can lead to large collective biases, thus providing an explorable explanation of systemic societal biases. (Citation: Hart and Case, 2014)

  

By 2012, Explorable explanations were gaining momentum, as authors in education, journalism, and data science began to see the potential these interactive tools had for transforming their fields. Educators were recognising the value of engaging students in a more active role, where critical thinking was not just encouraged but required. Journalists, on platforms such as Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight, were starting to experiment with these tools, using them to elucidate complex datasets and statistical models, allowing their readers to interact with and digest intricate information through hands-on exploration.

  

Yet, despite these burgeoning explorations, there was a lingering challenge in defining what exactly constituted an explorable explanation. Was it distinct from a simulation, a game, or an interactive educational tool? The boundaries remained blurred. It was difficult to pinpoint a single instance that encapsulated the entire concept until "Snowfall" arrived and set a new benchmark. It was a traditional article, not an embedded video or interactive demo, but the careful and innovative touches of interactivity they added hit the collective imagination as something new and useful. And not just that, it won a Pulitzer.

  

### The Importance of Snowfall

  

When The New York Times released the "Snow Fall" interactive feature (Citation: Duenes & Kueneman, 2012), it sparked waves of excitement within the digital media industry. This unprecedented piece of multimedia storytelling, a long-form article punctuated by interactive graphics, videos, and immersive animations, seemed to herald the dawn of a new era for online media. Snowfall was a trailblazer, representing a powerful blend of traditional journalistic storytelling and interactive elements, promising an engaging and immersive reader experience.

  

The innovative approach of Snowfall was met with critical acclaim, winning the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing. Its influence was quickly seen in the proliferation of 'Snowfall-like' features across the digital media landscape, as news outlets and other media organisations sought to emulate its success. The term 'Snowfall' even became a verb within the industry, describing the process of creating rich, multimedia experiences within a long-form article.

  

However, the initial enthusiasm surrounding Snowfall was soon tempered. Despite the benefits of the new format, it was still hard to use, buggy, and complicated. The production of Snowfall was a costly endeavour, both in terms of time and resources. It required a team of skilled developers and designers working intensively over several months to bring the project to fruition. This high level of investment was not a feasible model for most media outlets, particularly for those with smaller budgets or shorter timelines.

  

Furthermore, the feature was not without technical issues. Users reported numerous bugs, with interactive elements often failing to load properly or behaving inconsistently across different devices and browsers. The high-quality multimedia content, while visually impressive, was also demanding on system resources, leading to slow load times and performance issues for users with less powerful computers or slower internet connections.

  

The conundrum posed by "Snowfall" is far from unique in the history of technological innovation. History is full of pioneering ideas that have stumbled at the crossroads of potential and practicality. Take, for example, the early days of virtual reality in the 1990s. As Durlach and Mavor noted in their 1995 work, these early VR systems often characterised by inelegant hardware, a nausea-inducing user experience, and prohibitive costs, making the technology not yet ripe for widespread adoption.

  

Similarly, consider the early generations of mass-produced electric cars, which emerged as a beacon of promise for a cleaner, more efficient future in personal transport. Initiated by major auto manufacturers in response to the evolving landscape of the 1970s and 1990s, these vehicles, including notable models like General Motors' EV1, embodied the potential for a significant shift in automotive technology. However, they were beset by substantial drawbacks. The quality of these early electric cars was often compromised by issues such as limited range, lengthy charging times, and a lack of necessary infrastructure. Furthermore, as Gandoman et al. (Citation: 2019) highlight, the reliability and safety of these early electric vehicles' components, including battery packs, power electronic converters, and electric motors, were significant concerns. Despite carrying the seeds of a greener future, these vehicles were emblematic of the challenges that pioneering technologies often face - showing a path forward, but not yet ready to meet the practical demands of the time (Citation: Team GridREV, 2011; Gandoman et al., 2019).

  

Both these examples underscore the fits and starts that any technology must suffer through before finding broad commercial success, if at all. Writer William Gibson has observed "the future is already here — it's just not very evenly distributed." Is this so? An average consumer, even a rich one, couldn't experience any kind of device we'd recognise as a smartphone in 1983, and the best technology in the world today can't reliably make nuclear fusion work. "But there were indeed prototype versions of smartphones as early as 1983 (Citation: History of mobile phones, n.d.) and prototypes of fusion power achieving significant breakthroughs in 2023 (Citation: Tollefson, 2023)." The question is not whether or not the future "exists" (a low bar if speculative fiction and forgotten research papers counts as "existing") but instead if the technology is good enough for mainstream commercialised appeal. The length of time between a product's invention to commercialisation, then from market formation, expansion, and eventually saturation, can stretch for a long time. For example, chatGPT only took two months to reach 100,000,000 users, but the concept of AI was first coined in 1956. OpenAI was founded in December 2015, GPT was built in 2018, GPT-3 arrived in 2020, and the chatGPT that became the fastest growing consumer product in human history wasn't released until November 2022. (Citation: UBS, 2023) Every step relied on the steps that came before it, but the impact to the rest of the world didn't come when the technology theoretically existed, but when normal people could benefit from it.

  

"Snowfall" was right on the cusp between being good enough to inspire and broken enough to frustrate. Its vision for a new storytelling paradigm was clear, but the tools and systems necessary for its realisation were not yet in place for broad acceptance. The challenge, then, as with all emerging technologies, was to close the gap between the vanguard of innovation and the trailing edge of accessibility. It was about finding scalable, efficient, and economically viable ways to deliver the rich potential of interactive media to all users, regardless of their technological or financial circumstances. The road from potential to ubiquity is rarely a straight line; it is a winding path marked by iteration, refinement, and the gradual democratisation of once-exclusive and experimental technologies.

  

### The Snowfall backlash (The Grain of the Web)

  

In 2015, three years post "Snowfall," Frank Chimero published "The Web's Grain," an insightful reflection on web design and digital interaction. (Citation: Chimero, 2015) Without directly mentioning "Snowfall," Chimero struck a chord with developers wrestling with similar issues. His concept of "grain" in media products, borrowed from the craft of woodworking, articulated a truth many sensed but hadn't named—it's the intrinsic nature of materials that should guide our creations.

  

Chimero's "grain" speaks to the inherent properties of any medium. Just as wood has a direction to its fibers that informs a carpenter's work, digital mediums have an inherent "grain" that should guide design. The most harmonious digital experiences, Chimero suggests, are those crafted in sync with the web’s flexible, interconnected nature, respecting its "edgelessness" or the absence of strict confines.

  

Snowfall, while innovative, arguably bucked against the web's grain. Its ambition outstripped its execution, becoming a resource-heavy behemoth that often stumbled across the varied landscape of devices and browsers. It lacked the fluidity and adaptability that Chimero identified as hallmarks of the web's true nature. This pioneering project was indeed a spectacle, but one that perhaps flew too close to the sun, revealing the delicate balance between innovation and the current technological reach. It underscored the necessity for digital creations to not only push boundaries but also to move in harmony with the ever-evolving digital ecosystem.

  

Chimero might argue that this approach ran counter to the web's inherent fluidity and adaptability. While the project harnessed some of the web's potential for rich multimedia storytelling, its complex design and performance issues revealed a misalignment with the web's grain.

  

Yet, despite these flaws, the concept behind Snowfall aligns with Chimero's vision of embracing the web's unique capacities. The New York Times's interactive feature represents an attempt to leverage the web's potential for creating immersive, interconnected experiences that transcend traditional linear storytelling. Even though its execution was not perfect, the ambition and innovation behind Snowfall signalled a step towards more engaging and interactive forms of online content.

  

Chimero’s essay urges us to step back from the precipice of overcomplicated, overly-ambitious design and to reconsider the fundamental properties of the web – a more versatile, flexible and inherently complex medium than any that have come before. This call for a return to simplicity, however, is not a call for stagnation or resistance against innovation. Rather, it is a challenge to embrace the medium in its fullness, harness its unique properties, and wield these attributes to push the boundaries of digital storytelling.

  

Seen through this lens, "Snowfall" isn’t so much a failed experiment, but an important milestone that stretched the conceptual limits of online communication. It unveiled a tantalising glimpse of the web’s potential while laying bare the challenges of aligning with the web’s unique grain. This experience showed us the value in creating digital narratives that are innovative, accessible, and engaging – narratives that ride with the web's grain rather than against it.

  

The promise of Snowfall, then, isn't in the specific form it took but rather the vision it represented – a vision of using the web's unique capacities for storytelling, learning, and understanding. It's about blending the strengths of the medium with content, not wedging content into unwieldy software experiences.

  

However, to translate this vision into practice, we need to focus on what makes online documents successful: text, video, images, and embedded widgets. These components are not just passive containers of information, but dynamic instruments of communication, each with its unique way of engaging users and conveying meaning.

  

In addition to these, we introduce the concept of responsive communication - an innovative approach that focuses on enhancing comprehension and interactivity. To truly harness the web's grain, we must design digital experiences that respond to users' actions and adapt to their needs. These can range from interactive diagrams that users can manipulate to gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter, to smart annotations that provide additional information on demand, to simulations that allow users to explore different scenarios and outcomes.

  

These components create a more holistic and immersive experience. They do not function as separate, disconnected pieces wedged into a page but as a cohesive whole. They become a part of the narrative, supplementing and enhancing the main text rather than distracting from it.

  

But, as we move towards embracing these new tools and approaches, we must not lose sight of the core of all communication: words. The fundamental purpose of any digital communication, no matter how visually stunning or interactively engaging, is to convey meaning through content.

  

Therefore, we propose creating a component library - a collection of versatile, reusable components that seamlessly integrate into the narrative flow, enhancing the storytelling and learning process. A tool like this allows us to avoid the pitfall of over-complication, keeping us grounded in our ultimate goal: to communicate effectively.

  

In essence, our journey from Snowfall, through The Web's Grain, and back to words represents a shift in our understanding and approach to digital storytelling. It's about recognising the unique grain of the web and using it to create more meaningful, effective, and engaging experiences. It's about finding that sweet spot between innovation and accessibility, where the technology enhances the narrative rather than overwhelming it.

### Literature review



## Methodology

- We'll start with the idea that understanding more, faster is better. Understanding less, slower is worse.
- We'll scope things down to be as close to the standard reading experience as possible. (We're not comparing to movies and multimedia)
- We'll establish what the "essence" of reading is so we can establish heuristics and metrics against that definition
- Then we'll survey a wide range of innovative reading experiences and rate them based on those key metrics ("in flow", understandable, and technically feasible)
- (Refer to contextual analysis, heuristic evaluation, and the code example gallery I'll be putting together. Also the CORS )

## Literature review

- I analysed a whole bunch of work around explorable explanations, because I thought they had the most promise
- I was left thinking that their research is overlooking how hard it is to make these things, and how hard adoption is and will be
- I chose to focus more narrowly: not whether or not explorable explanations are cool, but setting out some core heuristics I will be measuring
- (more details here)



## Findings

(I'll have a whole section here, below is just my raw notes explaining what I'm seeing so far)

- **(Traditional) Reading an Easy Passage**: Our baseline is reading something simple: perfectly in flow, perfectly understandable, and technically simple.
- **(Traditional) Reading a Complex Passage**: Compare to reading something complex, such as Shakespeare, complex science materials, etc: in flow, not understandable, still technically simple.
- **(Traditional) Following a Footnote**: Can interrupt flow but well-understood and provides helpful context. Many readers will skip past due to the complexity, but if the footnote could be pulled forward digitally, they'd be much more likely to investigate.
- **(Traditional) Following a Reference to Other Media**: Compare to the far other end of the spectrum: if a book referred to something in a YouTube video, it would take you out of flow but could be highly understandable. It's also very technically complex.
- **(Digital) Popover footnotes**: by using a standard popover effect, footnotes can provide context with minimal cognitive effort.

<img src="media/spreadsheet1.png" />

- **(Traditional) Remembering Where You Last Left Off**: Can interrupt flow and be less helpful, especially if the reader loses track, thus adding reader complexity.
- **(Digital) Last Read Indicator**: Helps maintain flow and is helpful without adding complexity for the author or the reader.
- **(Traditional) Comparing Two Images Across Two Pages**: May interrupt flow but provides assistance, without adding significant complexity for the reader.
- **(Digital) Before and After Slider**: Maintains flow and is helpful, allowing for direct comparison without adding complexity.
