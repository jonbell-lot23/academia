# Augmented Text

## Abstract

**Introduction to Augmented Text**
Traditional reading was an analog experience, with no interactivity. On the other hand, the modern experience of multimedia is often very interactive but harder to read with the same flow as a book. Augmented Text aims to take the best from both worlds, the feeling of flow while reading a book, but with the assistance of software.

**Research Objective**
This work addresses one question: How can we enhance the reading experience through technology without compromising the essence of traditional reading? It utilities a methodology that combines qualitative and quantitative approaches in order to quantify the "essence" of traditional reading with enhancements that benefit readers of educational and informational content.
## Introduction

**Reading is not natural, and comprehension is hard**
The evolution of literacy, as explored in "Proust and the Squid" by Maryanne Wolf, underscores the intricate cognitive processes involved in reading and understanding text. Wolf's analysis reveals that reading is not an innate human ability but a complex skill that our brains have adapted to perform over thousands of years, fundamentally changing the way we think, communicate, and perceive the world​​​[](https://mindfultechnics.com/proust-and-the-squid-book-review/)​. Reading, as opposed to simply hearing words, activates a unique interplay of brain circuits, fostering deeper comprehension and critical thinking. This is in stark contrast to oral traditions, which Noam Chomsky and others have established are innate to the human experience, and require less effort to master.

Because comprehending the written word is such a specialised process, humankind has long relied on tools and intermediaries to not just read, but to more deeply comprehend and understand. Educational institutions and religious organisations are the most obvious examples at a societal level, but it can be argued that most of human experience isn't about the lived experience, but making sense of it. This means that comprehension, not just experience, is a focal point for society. From the ancient scribes of organised religions who transcribed sacred texts, making the profound teachings accessible to a broader audience, to the establishment of universities in the medieval period, which became centres for scholarly study and interpretation of complex works, these intermediaries have been instrumental in the dissemination of knowledge. They not only provided the tools for literacy but also fostered an environment where comprehension and critical thinking were cultivated.

**Software can help with comprehension, but at what cost?**
With the development of the printing press and then the internet, the volume of things to read and experience increased exponentially, but the ability to comprehend is still at a premium. Educational and media organisations who initially turned to multimedia such as audio and video then discovered more complex forms of educational software to assist with comprehending information, from explainer videos to interactive data visualisations to simulations and educational software. While this has happened, the rise of more shallow reading patterns in the digital age has brought up questions about the potential impact on deep thinking, understanding, and comprehension. We've never had more media to consume, and more ways to understand it, leading to a bounty of opportunity but also a feeling of overwhelm. We have more ways than ever to be helped, but are those helpful features distracting from the essence of a reading experience?

Bret Victor's concepts of Explorable Explanations and Active Essays stand out as pioneering examples of how text can be augmented to offer more interactive and immersive learning experiences. These innovations allow readers to engage with content in dynamic ways, enabling a deeper exploration of topics and concepts through interactive visuals, simulations, and embedded coding environments. However, this evolution towards increasingly feature-rich digital texts brings forth a critical question: at what point does the augmentation of books with software and interactive elements detract from the essence of traditional reading? "The Web's Grain," a critique on digital text design, serves as a cautionary reference point, highlighting the potential pitfalls of over-augmentation. It suggests that there exists a delicate balance between enhancing the readability and educational value of text through digital means and preserving the core experience of reading that books have offered for centuries. The challenge lies in integrating technological advancements in a way that complements rather than overwhelms the fundamental nature of reading, ensuring that books retain their intrinsic value as a medium for thought, reflection, and learning in the digital age.

**The central question we're looking to address**

> How can we enhance the reading experience through technology without compromising the essence of traditional reading?

This inquiry seeks to find a sweet spot between software and traditional books, where the augmentation of text with digital tools enriches the reader's engagement and understanding without eroding the fundamental experience of reading—a practice deeply rooted in human culture and cognitive processes.

To address this, the research will explore a spectrum of experimental experiences that range from the simplicity of traditional books to the complexity of highly interactive software. This exploration aims to identify strategies and methodologies that preserve the core of reading while leveraging the potential of modern technology to make texts more accessible, interactive, and engaging. By examining instances where multimedia integration has either stalled or failed to enhance the reading experience, such as in the stagnation of flowing multimedia or the limited impact of games in this context, the study will highlight the limitations of current approaches.

Furthermore, the assertion that clinging solely to the traditional reading experience is inadequate in today's digital age underpins the necessity for a nuanced approach. This research advocates for a middle ground that respects the timeless value of literacy and the contemplative nature of reading, while embracing the possibilities that digital innovations offer for making texts more alive, interactive, and tailored to individual learning styles.

Through a methodological framework that includes both theoretical analysis and practical experimentation, this study aims to contribute to the ongoing dialogue about the evolution of reading in the digital era. It will seek to offer insights and recommendations for designers, educators, and content creators on how to craft reading experiences that are both enriched by technology and deeply respectful of the literary tradition that has shaped human thought and culture for millennia.

### Methodology

**Methodological Overview**
This work employs a mixed-methods approach. First, it uses the Touch Level Model (TLM) for comparative analysis of different reading-based interactions, such as the scoring the relative time it takes to access a footnote in print versus digital formats. Next, Nielsen's Heuristic Evaluation is utilised to assess four key areas: Flow, Utility, Development Effort, and Customisation Effort. These four metrics provide a qualitative measure of the augmented text's design and usability, and will be defined in further detail below. Finally, we'll factor in Raskin's Efficiency Score, an analysis of Fitts' Law, and Hick's Law. By scoring interactions across multiple heuristics, we aim to provide a wide-ranging score that helps understand the pros and cons of each approach.
    
**Criteria Definition**
To develop a comprehensive evaluation model for augmented text, the methodology combines several components, each contributing unique insights:

1. **Touch Level Model (TLM):** Quantifies touch interactions, providing a baseline for comparing the efficiency of gestures and taps in augmented texts.
2. **Flow:** Measures how seamlessly users can navigate and engage with the text, emphasizing the importance of a distraction-free reading experience.
3. **Utility:** Evaluates the added value of augmented features in enhancing understanding and engagement, highlighting the relevance and effectiveness of these enhancements.
4. **Development Effort:** Assesses the resources required to implement augmented features, considering both time and technical complexity.
5. **Customization Effort:** Examines the ease with which users can personalize their reading experience, reflecting on user autonomy and adaptability.
6. **Raskin's Efficiency Measures:** Applies a broader view of information efficiency, focusing on how effectively augmented text conveys information with minimal user effort.
7. **Fitts’ Law:** Integrates principles of human motor system behavior to evaluate the physical ease of interacting with augmented text features.
8. **Hick’s Law:** Considers the cognitive load in decision-making, particularly how feature variety and complexity impact user choices and response times.

Combining these elements provides a holistic view, balancing objective performance metrics with subjective user experience assessments. This "cocktail" of data offers a nuanced understanding of augmented text's impact, guiding optimisations that enhance readability, engagement, and ease of use without compromising the essence of reading

**Approach:** This study will analyse a variety of reading tasks that individuals may encounter, utilising a custom report card to score different approaches to augmented text. By assessing how each approach fares against specific criteria such as flow, utility, development effort, and customisation effort, the study will provide a personalised evaluation of the effectiveness of various augmented reading experiences. This method allows for a nuanced comparison of how different technologies and design choices impact the reading process.

**Limitations and Concepts Out of Scope:**

- The analysis will not include objective data for task completion times or effectiveness.
- There will be no surveys or interviews conducted with a diverse group of participants; instead, the study relies on one researcher's value judgments and estimates.
- The focus is on evaluating augmented text through theoretical and subjective lenses rather than empirical user data collection.

**Ethical Considerations:** Not applicable to this study, as it does not involve human participants or data collection that raises ethical concerns.
