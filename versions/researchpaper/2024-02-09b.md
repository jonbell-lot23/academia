# Augmented Text

## Abstract

This research paper will seek to answer a key question: "How much can software improve the comprehension of text while still retaining the essence of the reading experience?"

(Stay tuned)
## Introduction

- The written word changed everything, and books are great
- But reading something is one concept, whereas understanding it is something else entirely
- History is full of examples of people helping people understand words, from organised religion to universities
- As good as traditional books are, software can do so much more to help
- Explorable Explanations and Active Essays envisioned a world where text helps more
- But at what point does a book add so many features and software that it becomes unwieldy and no longer a book?
- How can we make the reading experience better without losing the essence of what it means to read?
- This work will survey a range of experimental experiences between simple books and complex software to find the sweet spot

## Literature review

- I analysed a whole bunch of work around explorable explanations, because I thought they had the most promise
- I was left thinking that their research is overlooking how hard it is to make these things, and how hard adoption is and will be
- I chose to focus more narrowly: not whether or not explorable explanations are cool, but setting out some core heuristics I will be measuring
- (more details here)

## Methodology

- We'll start with the idea that understanding more, faster is better. Understanding less, slower is worse.
- We'll scope things down to be as close to the standard reading experience as possible. (We're not comparing to movies and multimedia)
- We'll establish what the "essence" of reading is so we can establish heuristics and metrics against that definition
- Then we'll survey a wide range of innovative reading experiences and rate them based on those key metrics ("in flow", understandable, and technically feasible)
- (Refer to contextual analysis, heuristic evaluation, and the code example gallery I'll be putting together. Also the CORS )

## Findings

(I'll have a whole section here, below is just my raw notes explaining what I'm seeing so far)

- **(Traditional) Reading an Easy Passage**: Our baseline is reading something simple: perfectly in flow, perfectly understandable, and technically simple.
- **(Traditional) Reading a Complex Passage**: Compare to reading something complex, such as Shakespeare, complex science materials, etc: in flow, not understandable, still technically simple.
- **(Traditional) Following a Footnote**: Can interrupt flow but well-understood and provides helpful context. Many readers will skip past due to the complexity, but if the footnote could be pulled forward digitally, they'd be much more likely to investigate.
- **(Traditional) Following a Reference to Other Media**: Compare to the far other end of the spectrum: if a book referred to something in a YouTube video, it would take you out of flow but could be highly understandable. It's also very technically complex.
- **(Digital) Popover footnotes**: by using a standard popover effect, footnotes can provide context with minimal cognitive effort.

- **(Traditional) Remembering Where You Last Left Off**: Can interrupt flow and be less helpful, especially if the reader loses track, thus adding reader complexity.
- **(Digital) Last Read Indicator**: Helps maintain flow and is helpful without adding complexity for the author or the reader.
- **(Traditional) Comparing Two Images Across Two Pages**: May interrupt flow but provides assistance, without adding significant complexity for the reader.
- **(Digital) Before and After Slider**: Maintains flow and is helpful, allowing for direct comparison without adding complexity.
- **(Digital) Snowfall (New York Times)**: Though it may interrupt flow due to its interactive nature, it provides a rich, helpful narrative experience at the cost of increased author and reader complexity.
- **(Digital) Parable of the Polygons**: Could interrupt flow with its interactive nature, but provides assistance in understanding complex topics; however, it adds some complexity for the reader and the author.

(Things below here are still being noodled on)

- **Digital) Article Diff**: May disrupt reading flow due to its interactive comparison nature, but is helpful for understanding changes in content. Adds author complexity due to the need to curate content versions, and reader complexity due to the engagement required.
- **(Digital) Interactive Numbers**: Interactive elements can interrupt the flow of reading, yet they are helpful in contextualizing data. They present moderate complexity for both authors and readers.
- **(Digital) Summarise Widget**: While it may disrupt the reading flow, it provides a concise overview, aiding comprehension with moderate complexity for the reader and the author.
- **(Traditional) Reading on the Web**: Maintains good reading flow and provides access to hyperlinked resources for deeper exploration, potentially interrupting flow but greatly enhancing understandability with moderate technical complexity.
- **(Pending) YouTube Videos**: Can break the reading flow due to switching mediums but are highly helpful in understanding complex topics, with moderate technical complexity for both authors and readers.
- **(Pending) Plugins**: Slightly disrupt flow but offer helpful tools for interaction, such as note-taking or highlighting, with moderate technical complexity.
- **(Pending) Browser Extensions**: Can enhance web reading experiences with features like ad-blocking or readability improvements, with minimal disruption to flow and low technical complexity.
- **(Pending) Dataviz**: Maintains reading flow and offers visually engaging explanations that enhance understanding, with moderate author complexity and low reader complexity.
- **(Pending) Explorable Explanations**: Disrupts flow due to interactive elements but is highly helpful in providing deep understanding, with high technical complexity for both authors and readers.
- **(Pending) The Bike Guy**: Maintains flow and offers clear explanations through visuals, with moderate author complexity and low reader complexity.
- **(Pending) Loopy**: \[Missing evaluation indicators\]
- **(Pending) Google's Explorable Site**: \[Missing evaluation indicators\]
- **(Pending) Traditional Apps**: Can disrupt flow due to their varied nature but provide helpful features like customization and annotations, with moderate technical complexity.
- **(Pending) Active Essays**: Maintain good flow and are highly helpful with their integration of text and interactive elements, with moderate technical complexity for both authors and readers.
- **(Pending) Snowfall**: Though it may interrupt flow due to its interactive nature, it provides a rich, helpful narrative experience at the cost of increased author and reader complexity.
- **(Pending) Minecraft**: Significantly disrupts traditional reading flow due to its game-based nature but offers a highly interactive and engaging learning experience, with high technical complexity.
- **(Pending) Visual Novels**: Maintain a good narrative

## Discussion/Conclusion

- (Stay tuned)

## Limitations

- So many limitations! I'll be leaning hard on this
- Specifically, my work isn't tracking objective metrics. It's more qualitative.

## Future Work

## Ethical considerations

- Not much will go here
