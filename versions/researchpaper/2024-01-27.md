# Augmented Text

## Abstract

This research explores the untapped potential of augmented text, bridging the gap between traditional text-based content and interactive digital media. Drawing inspiration from the concepts of "active essays" and "Explorable Explanations," it seeks to redefine writing as an interactive, thought-provoking medium. Through a comprehensive survey of innovative augmented text examples, this study distills successful strategies for enhancing reader engagement and understanding. The centerpiece is a feature library, showcasing practical augmented text techniques with working code and interactive prototypes, aimed at inspiring future innovation in responsive communication. Employing a combination of literature review and contextual analysis, this research aims to contextualize augmented text within the broader digital communication landscape, fostering a new understanding and application of this emerging field.

## Introduction

<DancingAboutArchitecture />

Let's ponder this for a moment—the little 'Explain Like I'm Five' feature you just witnessed is a little parlour trick that traditional books can't replicate. The closest you come come in a conventional book might be a "turn to page 83 to see this described so a 5 year old could understand it," feature. A user might awkwardly flip back and forth between an advanced explanation and a simplified one, but it's clunky and doesn't flow in the same way.

And what if we want to adapt the text even further? Imagine trying to accommodate someone with dyslexia by altering the font, shielding a reader from content they might find distressing, or providing detailed teaching materials for teaching complex concepts like Shakespeare. These concepts far exceed the technological abilities of standard books, so most don't even try. And those who do feel awkward and unwieldy, with supporting content and insights relegated to footnotes, never a cohesive part of the core reading experience.

If we agree that the act of reading can be improved with increased context, we might swing to the other end of the spectrum and make everything into standalone apps or websites. While those solutions may provide more context and assistance, they would be frustrating. No one wants to download a new app for every book they read. Even if these apps came packed with every conceivable feature, the sheer bulk of information in the reading experience would make them unwieldy as well, adding intolerable cognitive weight to what should be a simple act of reading.

At its heart, augmented text is about preserving the simplicity and joy of reading while carefully and discreetly weaving in layers of interactivity. These digital features are nimble, unobtrusive, and responsive to our individual needs, whether it's toggling between an advanced and simplified explanation with a simple click or changing the visual presentation for accessibility. They're there when you need them, invisible when you don't, enhancing our understanding without overshadowing the text itself. Thus the principles of **seamless blending** and **concise enhancement**.

Think of augmented text as a book that responds to each user's individual needs. It's the bridge between the static page and the dynamic world of digital possibilities. A canvas where text is no longer just ink on paper but a helpful entity that adapts to the unique needs of its reader. It's an environment where the barriers to understanding are lowered, not by replacing the book, but by enhancing it in ways that were once the exclusive domain of science fiction.

And that's what this paper will explore—how augmented text takes the timeless act of reading and imbues it with the adaptability of the digital age. Just as a chameleon changes its colours to suit its environment, augmented text reshapes itself to suit the reader's needs. It's reading, reimagined for a world where the written word is no longer static, but dynamic; not fixed, but fluid; not one-size-fits-all, but personalised. It's a quiet revolution, a gentle augmentation of the reading experience that promises to make it richer, more accessible, and infinitely more adaptable. It's an step forward that is long overdue.

## Literature Review

### In the beginning, there were words

The essence of storytelling has never changed. From ancient tales shared around the fire to today's digital narratives, the objective has always been to inform, entertain, persuade, and connect on as wide a scale as possible. Just as ancient storytellers might have held their listeners spellbound with memorable narratives around a campfire, so do modern podcasts, TED Talks, and Netflix shows. Cuneiform, the printing press, and the internet are extraordinarily different technologies and implementations yet are aiming towards the same noble goal: reaching as many people as possible to communicate as effectively as possible.

There are parallels between old and new, because storytelling is core to the human experience. While tools and technologies evolve, the fundamental human need for communication remains. Augmented text, with its interactive and multimedia capabilities, is simply the latest iteration in this continuum. It takes the essence of what has always been important in communication — clarity, impact, engagement, and accessibility — and builds upon it with the benefits afforded by modern technology that we're missing out on by not re-evaluating the experience of reading and improving it to keep pace with how people read in modern contexts.

By weaving this story arc through this research, we'll show that augmented text is not an faddish outlier in the history of communication but the next step of a natural progression. It embodies the same principles that have driven the development of communication methods for millennia, now accelerated by digital interactivity and the global reach of the internet. This perspective will serve to situate augmented text within a broader historical context, demonstrating its relevance and potential as the next step in the ongoing journey of human expression. We'll also illustrate why a next step is necessary, and why multimedia has plateaued since the invention of the hyperlink.

### Let's get specific

When our ancient ancestors narrated stories around the fire, they were not only preserving their heritage but also embedding the roots of language as we understand it today. This fundamental drive for communication echoes Noam Chomsky's influential linguistic theories. Chomsky (1957) introduced the groundbreaking concept of a "universal grammar," proposing that certain aspects of linguistic structure are innate to the human mind and thus universally present in all languages. This perspective, which he further developed in his later works (Chomsky, 1965), implies that the capacity for language is biologically hardwired rather than acquired. Chomsky's theories, as expounded in his subsequent works (Chomsky, 2005), suggest that this innate language facility has played a critical role in human evolution, shaping our ability to communicate complex ideas and narratives. The transition from oral tradition to written language, a pivotal moment in the history of human communication, can be viewed through the lens of Chomsky's linguistic framework. Lewandowska-Tomaszczyk (2016) further expounded on the evolution and impact of Chomsky's generative grammar, underscoring its significance in the progression from oral storytelling to the written word. These theoretical insights provide a deeper understanding of the intrinsic nature of language and its role in human civilisation.

Around 3400 BC, Sumerian scribes in Mesopotamia laid the groundwork for the first known form of written communication, called cuneiform. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform) This intricate system of wedge-shaped marks pressed into clay tablets allowed the recording of inventories, laws, and narratives, marking a significant improvement around how humankind preserved and disseminated knowledge. This allowed information to outlive its author and be shared with audiences for the first time. The impact of this technology cannot be overstated; it's easily on par with the invention of the wheel and fire, and was the precursor, however humbly, to the contemporary reading experience we experience today.

Tablets were a good start, but they were hardly portable. This lead to the invention of paper by the Chinese around the 1st century AD. Then the printing press, invented by Johannes Gutenberg in 15th century Europe, took the revolution a step further by making the process easier and widely available. Knowledge was no longer the exclusive domain of the affluent and the clergy; it was accessible to anyone who could read. (Kross et al., 2021) Like cuneiform and paper before it, this technology permanently changed the way humanity communicated, and the resulting impact, again, cannot be overstated. As Albertin et al. (2018) explore, the forces unleashed when information became more portable weren't all good or all bad. They simply accelerated many good and bad aspects of society, an insight that seems familiar to us today with all the promise and peril of the modern internet.

The evolution from spoken word to written, then from expensive to cheap, set up the desktop and internet revolutions of the late 20th century, followed by the explosion of smartphone usage, which made communication as cheap and plentiful as it’s ever been. Today, the combination of the internet and mobile means we've never had more content, in reach of as many people (both in absolute terms and per capita), being produced by more people. Yet the technology we're using to communicate multimedia concepts has stayed surprisingly static for the last 50 years. With the exception of the popularisation of the hyperlink in the 1990s, there has been very little technological innovation that has changed the way we consume the written word.

We used to speak around campfires, whereas now we record podcasts, shoot Instagram stories, and record video chats. But at their heart, it's all just verbal communication. We used to write stories, first on caves, then on tablets, then on paper. Now we've added websites, status updates, ebooks, and group texts, but and their heart, they're all just textual communication. You can tell the same stories about music and video; music has always been music, even as the technology powering them changes and evolves. Movies have always been movies, whether black and white, full colour, 3d, or VR. And the consumption experiences for all have stayed largely the same as well. We still watch movies and plays in theatres, we still listen to music on our own or as part of a group concert. We still watch people tell stories, whether around a campfire, on YouTube, or at a stand-up comedy show. The more things change, the more they stay the same.

"By perceiving modern digital formats like the Kindle, YouTube videos, or online news stories as mere digital versions of their traditional counterparts, we risk missing opportunities for more impactful communication. This oversight is akin to the initial limitations of early websites and TV shows, which merely replicated existing physical and broadcast formats. Neil Postman, in his seminal work 'Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business,' echoes this concern, critiquing the tendency to view new media forms as mere extensions of the old without acknowledging their unique characteristics and implications (Citation: Postman, 1985). He warns against the uncritical acceptance of these forms, urging a more nuanced examination of how they shape communication and discourse. This phenomenon highlights the importance of seamlessly blending new technologies with traditional media. Just as television evolved from the simplicity of 'I Love Lucy' to the complexity of 'Game of Thrones,' our understanding and use of digital media must also progress. While the essence of storytelling remains constant, the methods of delivery should be enhanced, aiming for both conciseness and seamless integration with emerging technologies."

The realm of interactive media and multimedia, while often static in its approach, contrasts sharply with the dynamic nature of games, which have consistently been a fertile ground for interactive innovations. This distinction is particularly evident in the work of Barr, who explores the unique aspects of human-computer interaction within video games. In his research, Barr (Citation: 2008) emphasises that unlike traditional software, video games are played rather than used, necessitating a different approach to understanding interaction—one that considers 'play' as a central component. His analysis of how players' beliefs and values about preferable conduct influence their interaction with games sheds light on the multi-layered complexity of gaming as a form of human-computer interaction. This perspective is crucial for comprehending the interactive depth of games and their potential for innovation in the broader multimedia landscape, and why it far exceeds the narrow scope of what a reading experience demands.

This raises some crucial questions: Can elements from gaming be integrated seamlessly with traditional communication forms in a way that enhances rather than complicates the simple act of reading and the plain goal of communicating clearly? Does "play" automatically cause text to move from the realm of reading and into something more cognitively heavy, and therefore less effective as text? The answers are nuanced, and this exploration will delve into how interactive elements can be incorporated concisely and seamlessly into augmented text. Our aim is to explore how these interactive components can enrich the storytelling experience without overwhelming the core message, and therefore adhering to the principles of augmented text.

The evolution of human communication, from oral traditions to digital narratives, reveals a continuous pursuit of more effective and engaging forms of expression. This historical journey underpins the need for augmented text, which can be seen as the next significant leap in this evolutionary path. Augmented text, emerging from the convergence of traditional text and interactive digital media, promises to enrich the reading experience by incorporating elements of interactivity and multimedia. However, it is crucial to critically analyze and identify where augmented text can provide the most benefit, and where it may fall short in comparison to other forms of communication.

Contemporary research highlights the importance of user interaction in digital media and the cognitive load associated with multimedia learning. These studies provide insights into how augmented text can be designed to enhance understanding and engagement without overwhelming the reader. The gap in the current literature, particularly around the optimal use and limitations of augmented text, is where this research aims to contribute. By exploring the balance between text, interactivity, and multimedia, this research seeks to identify the contexts in which augmented text can be most effective.

The future implications of augmented text are far-reaching. It has the potential to transform how we communicate, learn, and access information. In educational settings, augmented text could provide more dynamic and personalized learning experiences. In digital communication, it could lead to more engaging and interactive content. However, the key lies in understanding and leveraging its strengths while being mindful of its limitations.

As this research progresses into the methodology section, these questions will guide the investigation: Where does augmented text benefit readers most? In what scenarios do other forms of communication outperform augmented text? How can augmented text be utilized effectively in the right contexts? The answers to these questions will not only provide a deeper understanding of augmented text but also chart a path for its future development and application.
