## Abstract

**What is Augmented Text?**

Reading a physical book can be a great immersive experience, but it has no tools for aiding comprehension. If you come across a word you don't know, a concept that is confusing, or a reference to other work, a reader is forced to stop reading and use a different tool to gain a deeper understanding. On the other hand, interactive software can aid comprehension by developing features to explain words, concepts, or references to other work in an embedded way. But these features come at a cost: software is distracting.

Consider a reader deep in flow while reading an engrossing page-turner on a beach. Now compare that to the feeling of having 127 browser tabs open while trying to do research and comprehend a complex topic. It's hard to find flow when you're being bombarded with information, and it's hard to understand what you're reading when staring at a dense white paper full of jargon and complex cross-referencing. Augmented Text aims to take the best from both words, by combining the flow a person can experience while reading a novel with the power of comprehension-aiding software tools.

**Research Objective**

This work addresses one question: How can we enhance the reading experience through technology without compromising the essence of traditional reading? It utilises a methodology that combines qualitative and quantitative approaches in order to quantify the "essence" of traditional reading with enhancements that benefit readers of educational and informational content.

## Introduction

#### What is the essence of a great reading experience?
Before we get started, let's define what "essence" means in the context of this work, because it's a bedrock concept everything else will build on. First, my use of the word essence has nothing to do with physical characteristics such as the feel of binding, the ability to fold down the pages, or write in the margins. A person can have an equally wonderful reading experience on a digital screen or with a heavy hardcover book.

Instead, I'll be using the word essence to refer to how reading is an activity that requires focus and cannot be multi-tasked. When you're reading, you cannot also be watching a movie, conducting a conversation, or drawing. Because reading is a single-tasking activity, it allows for immersion and flow. This is why reading a book on your phone can be a grey area. It's easy to get immersed in the reading experience, but it's also easy for a software notifications to interrupt you from another app. This is a place where a physical book has an advantage, because it's a single-tasking object, with no ability for TikTok to tap you on the shoulder and encourage you to watch cat videos.

But as we'll see as we proceed through the work, ease of reading is different from ease of comprehension. It's possible to read a book and be fully immersed but not actually understand what it's telling you. This is a shame, and something I have wanted to address since I was a young man in school.

#### Motivation
When my teacher taught us Gustave Flaubert’s famous 1857 book _Madame Bovary_, he ran an experiment to help us understand the art of translation. (T. Munson, personal communication, 1996). He asked us to read three different English-language translations of the famous work, and report back our findings. Translations one and two were fine. The first scene introduces us to a classroom where an awkward young boy is starting his first day of school, and everyone is laughing at him. But translation three went further with a key footnote that the prior translations lacked.

> "Stand up," said the teacher, "and tell me your name."
> 
> The new boy articulated, in a mumbling voice, a name that was inaudible.
> 
> "Again!" \[...\]
> 
> The new boy, resolved to do his utmost, opened a gigantic mouth and with all his might, as if he were calling somebody, hurled out one word: Charbovari. (3)
> 
> In one second all hell broke loose; rising to a crescendo with shrill rippling voices (they yelled, they barked, they stamped, they echoed: Charbovari! Charbovari!), rolling in isolated notes, subsiding most reluctantly, and abruptly starting off again along one bench from which there would erupt, like a squib still fizzing, bursts of stifled laughter.
> 
> However, under a deluge of penalties, order in the class was eventually restored, and the teacher, having managed to grasp the name of Charles Bovary, by having had it dictated, spelled out and read back to him.

Flipping to the end of the book, I was delighted to read the footnote.

>**3** The class’s wild reaction to the word **Charbovari** makes more sense once we realise that they are implicitly giving Charles’s name a further twist, miming the sound **Charbovari** as a **charivari.** They are enacting a spontaneous collective pun. 
>
>Originally, the **charivari** was a serenade of rough music made by a crowd of villagers banging on kettles and pans under the windows of a newly-wed couple. It was used especially to deride an incongruous marriage. Perhaps this is an ominous anticipation of Charles’s fate as a husband. However, by the middle of the nineteenth century **charivari** described the anarchic ritual mockery of an unpopular person.
>
>**Le Charivari** was also the name of a satirical magazine published in Paris during the early nineteenth century. It was the favourite reading of Flaubert’s boyhood, and when he was twelve years old, in 1833, there appeared within its pages a cartoon of a grotesque composite hat which may be the distant model for the one worn by Charles Bovary.
  
  This footnote changed my life. It is the moment I realised that footnotes could layer meaning on top of text, above and beyond simple definitions or citations. I thought back to my dad's patient lessons about Shakespeare, how phrases like "get thee to a nunnery" were purposely designed to speak on multiple levels. And I never again looked at text the same way. Why can't I look at a confusing parking sign and have a "comprehension layer" floating on top that just says "OK to park?" When I read a word I don't recognise, why do I need to multi-task with another book or app to learn its meaning? And perhaps most troubling of all: is comprehension a luxury? I had the benefit of a good teacher, plus three translations, plus a translation that went above and beyond to teach me something extraordinary. But most people, even with a great teacher and a desire to learn, wouldn't get this extra layer of meaning. And that's always seemed like a gap worth addressing.

  I've made a lifelong hobby from of idly pondering how to keep the good parts of reading – immersion, flow, and the development of knowledge – while also allowing for this deeper level of comprehension and understanding unlocked by great teachers and great explanations. I want every reader, regardless of socioeconomic status, level of access to advanced technology and great teachers, native language, reading ability, or learning disability to be able to have the experience I did in that classroom. Because while reading feels natural, comprehension is not. Our brains struggle to comprehend the deeper meaning of the written word, and need all the help they can get.
  
#### How our brain stands in the way of comprehension
It seems intuitive that both speaking and reading are skills we're all all born with. But it turns out that reading is not natural, and comprehension is hard. This striking insight is the core theme in “Proust and the Squid” (Wolf, 2007) which explains the intricate cognitive processes involved in reading and understanding text. Wolf’s analysis reveals that reading is not an innate human ability but a complex skill that our brains have adapted to perform over thousands of years, fundamentally changing the way we think, communicate, and perceive the world. Wolf asserts that reading, as opposed to simply hearing words, activates a unique interplay of brain circuits, fostering deeper comprehension and critical thinking. This is in stark contrast to oral traditions, which Noam Chomsky (1957, 1959) and others have established are innate to the human experience and require less effort to master.

So if we combine each of our assertions until now, we're stating that getting immersed in a book is a great experience, but reading is different from comprehension. Not only is it different, it's can be quite complicated, and only through fantastic teachers or context can we have the kind of experience I did with Madame Bovary as a young man. Which returns us to our main research question: how can we improve comprehension in the reading experience without adding so much complexity that we lose sight of the "essence" of reading, which is typified by a focused and immersive single-tasking mindset? As we've all experienced, software can just as easily be distracting and and unhelpful as it can be useful. So let's unpack how to decide what software is the good kind and which is the bad kind.

#### Software can help with comprehension, but adds complexity
With the development of the printing press and then the internet and smartphone apps, the volume of things to read and experience increased exponentially, but our tools for comprehension haven't kept pace. This makes it no surprise that a rise in shallow reading patterns has emerged, ushering in questions about the potential impact on deep thinking, understanding, and comprehension (Delgado & Salmerón, 2021; Nkonko et al., 2019). We've never had more media to consume, and more ways to understand it, leading to a bounty of opportunity but also a feeling of overwhelm (Komljenovič, 2021). We have more ways than ever to be helped, but are those helpful features distracting from the essence and comprehension of a traditional reading experience? If so, are we losing something in our ability to think deeply? Would the great thinkers of the past have made as much progress if they had Slack notifications enabled, 83 tabs calling for their attention, and TikTok a tap away? As we navigate these challenges, it becomes crucial to explore innovative approaches that can enhance and augment comprehension without sacrificing the deep engagement and immersive nature of traditional reading.

Explorable Explanations (Victor, 2011) and Active Essays (Kay, 2003) are pioneering examples of how text can be "augmented" to offer more interactive and immersive learning experiences, designed to assist with deeper levels of thinking and comprehension. These innovations allow readers to engage with content in dynamic ways, enabling a deeper exploration of topics and concepts through interactive visuals, simulations, and embedded coding environments. However, this evolution towards increasingly feature-rich digital texts brings forth a critical question: at what point does the augmentation of books with software and interactive elements detract from the immersion and single-tasking nature of traditional reading?

"The Web's Grain," a critique on digital text design by Frank Chimero, serves as a cautionary reference point, highlighting the potential pitfalls of overdoing software augmentation. It suggests that there exists a delicate balance between enhancing the readability and educational value of text through digital means and preserving the core experience of reading that books have offered for centuries (Chimero, 2015). The challenge lies in integrating technological advancements in a way that complements rather than overwhelms the the printed. The much-celebrated and awarded "Snowfall" from the New York Times (2012) exemplifies a successful integration of multimedia elements into narrative content, offering a model for how augmented text can enhance storytelling without compromising the reading experience. But successful and inspiring as examples like Snowfall were, they still assume a once-size-fits-all approach. Just as a teacher might modify their teaching style to each child, personalisation in software has tremendous opportunity to help readers understand more fully.

#### The importance of meeting the reader where they are

Imagine a person could touch on a word in any physical book and learn the definition right away. It wouldn’t require asking a friend, Googling, or consulting a professor. This process would be faster, tailored to the text, and even tailored to the era. For instance, tapping the phrase “software oligopolies” could reveal a definition saying, “these days, this might be written as ‘big tech,’ like Apple, Meta, Google, and Microsoft.” Or in the prior Madame Bovary example, deeper context could be available in nearly every passage, not just the ones called out for special consideration by the translator.

While this isn’t possible today with physical books, ebooks and other reading software are already moving in this direction, which we'll explore further in the literature review.
<div id="literature-review"></div>

## Literature Review

<div id="todo">
(NP: Overall comment: I think you need to elaborate a bit more on the existing research/literature review and frame it so that it makes it clear where is the gap/challenge that you are addressing. What you have currently is good/relevant but as a reader I am not sure how it leads and relates to what you did. A potential structure that I see is: I)Existing work on reading in the digital era; ii) active vs passive; iii) the GAP you are addressing. Of course this is just a suggestion)
</div>

#### What prior research has found

Between Wolf, Chomsky, and many others, we have ample academic grounding to understand much about the ability of the human mind to hear, read, and comprehend information. Wolf’s _Proust and the Squid_ (2007) delves into the cognitive processes involved in reading, revealing it as a complex skill that our brains have adapted to perform over thousands of years. Chomsky’s foundational works on linguistics, such as _Syntactic Structures_ (1957) and _Aspects of the Theory of Syntax_ (1965), establish the innate aspects of human language acquisition and processing.

Thanks to the efforts of the HCI community, particularly through the contributions of researchers like Nielsen (1994) and Raskin (2000), we have extensive data on what makes an interface successful and how to create humane interfaces. Educational theorists like Dewey (1938) and Vygotsky (1978) have also significantly contributed to our understanding of what aids reading comprehension both in and outside the classroom.

And yet, despite the depth of research found across these fields, it was harder to find the same rich academic research in the overlap between these three broad categories. One bright spot I found was Bret Victor's Explorable Explanations, which inspired a cottage industry of works animated by his core concepts. Could the concepts in Explorable Explanations be that blend of traditional reading and educational software that hit the sweet spot?

**What are Explorable Explanations?**

Bret Victor introduced Explorable Explanations to the world in 2011 with this definition:

> Explorable Explanations is my umbrella project for ideas that enable and encourage  truly active reading. The goal is to change people's relationship with text. People  currently think of text as information to be consumed. I want text to be used as an  environment to think in (Victor, 2011).

<div id="todo">
(NP: Follow this up by explaining how it relates to what you are presenting here. Is the bigger problem you are addressing the passive consumption of media and information? You don’t need to say yet what you are doing but you need to create the thread that will lead there and at the moment there are lots of threads and I am not sure as a reader where you are pointing me to.)
</div>

His introductory blog post then goes on to share several examples, which mostly present themselves as embedded educational software on a webpage. So rather than reading an essay on how electricity works, you'd instead engage with a multimedia experience that walked you through the concepts with a game-like level of interactivity.

Nicky Case created a website for tracking Explorable Explanations, where the definition for Explorable Explanations is listed thusly:

>"In short, by "explorable explanation" we mean something that 1) teaches something, and 2) is more interactive than a boring ol' quiz with only one right answer."

Other researchers have found these definitions helpful, to a point, but still vague. In the work "Explorable Explanations: What are they? What do they explain? How do we work with them? Let's find out," (2018), Fogh attempts to sort out a more firm definition, first by analysing Victor's initial defintion:

> \[...\] there seems to be only one main thread: interactivity. \[...\] However, what Victor means by text is not necessarily clear. Interestingly, he also talks of active ​reading​, as if reading is a necessity to  explorables. This would seem to put it more in the realm of interactive narratives, except within non-fiction. 

They then turn to Case's definition and finds it vague as well.

> In Case's definition interaction is included as one of only two criteria, but he is not very specific about what kind of interaction. \[...\] Case's definition also relies on the unspecific word "something". Looking at the examples on \[their\] page, it seems we are dealing with digital artefacts, but this definition does not wish to make this clear. 

With a little jab at the lack of definition, Fogh throws some academic shade when wondering with wry exasperation if a birch tree could be considered an explorable explanation:

> \[...\] the definition is broad enough that it might even include a birch tree, since I cannot confidently state that birch trees are not things that teach something by being more interactive than a boring ol' quiz.  

Fogh references a third quote about Explorable Explanations, from data journalist 
Maarten Lambrechts, who defined the concept in this way:

> "Explorable explanations (you could also call them dynamic texts or dynamic  documents) are documents users can interact with. They educate people not by just  combining text and static graphics, but by integrating interactives. So people can  really play with what they’re learning; with what they’re seeing. People can learn  something without realising they are learning something." (Lambrechts, 2018)

Fogh finds this expanded definition helpful, especially the addition of the concept of play, but is curious about the "stealth learning" angle Lambrechts mentions.

> Finally, in Lambrechts' definition, the term explorable explanations is described as interchangeable with dynamic documents or dynamic texts. Integral to his definition is also the inclusion of interactivity. He goes as far as using the word "play" to describe how the users can engage with the document and its educational content. This playing with the content seems to mirror Victor's notion of explorables as "an environment to think in" (Victor, 2011). However, Lambrechts also seems to feel that explorable explanations are closer to stealth learning games, such as Machineers (Lode et al., 2013), than to overt educational games, when he describes them as teaching without the player knowing that they are being taught.

<div id="todo">
(NP: This comment refers to all above content of the explorable explanations. These are some great stuff you have here but it is not clear why I need to know these? You need to contextualise (and potentially shorten some parts) so it becomes clear why these are relevant. Up to here I still don’t know why/how these relate to your earlier research question and motivation.)
</div>

Fogh went further than anyone else to date at trying to quantify exactly what Explorable Explanations meant, but was left as confused as me. Interactivity, play, and innovation all 

<div id="todo">
(NP: This part is looking better; it is actually contextualising a bit more why we are reading the excerpt below and starts to relate to your work more.)
</div>

seemed to play a role. I appreciated the drive towards making a "better" reading and learning experience for people, but who decides what better is? How can it be quantified? How can we determine the return on investment building a feature like this? Unfortunately, Fogh ran into a dead end on these questions, citing them as out of scope for his work.

>Back in 2007, Egenfeldt-Nielsen (2007) lamented that not a lot of studies have been done in the efficiency of educational games. I would argue that the same holds today for explorable explanations. Now that a first step has been taken in identifying the genre, the next step should be to see whether explorables are actually capable of educating players. With Bad News, a game about fake news, Rozenbeek and van der Linden (2018) have attempted to do just that by including a survey as part of the experience. This is one way to approach the issue, but there are surely other, more qualitative ways of doing so.

Surely there are. And that's what I'm hoping to explore and explain.
#### The central question we're looking to address

> How much can we enhance the reading experience through technology without compromising the essence of traditional reading?

<div id="todo">
(NP: \[So much\] reads like a very quantitative question but what you say right below re sweet spot  is very different)
</div>

<div id="todo">
(NP: Still don’t know what you mean with the essence so it is hard to know what you are actually studying. Make sure you explain or rephrase your question so that it more accurately explains what you are investigating.)
</div>

This inquiry seeks to find a sweet spot between software and traditional books, where the augmentation of text with digital tools enriches the reader's engagement and understanding without eroding the fundamental experience of reading—a practice deeply rooted in human culture and cognitive processes.

<div id="todo">
(NP: What is fundamental experience for your research. Need to be more specific.)
</div>

To address this, the research will explore a spectrum of experiences that range from the simplicity of traditional books to the complexity of experimental interactive software. This exploration aims to identify strategies and methodologies that preserve the core of reading while leveraging the potential of modern technology to make texts more accessible, interactive, and engaging.

<div id="todo">
(NP: I don’t think you were actually measuring or studying those in this work. Maybe can be next steps. Interesting and related but def out of scope for this work)
</div>


By examining instances where multimedia integration has either stalled or failed to enhance the reading experience, such as in the stagnation of multimedia or the limited impact of games in this context, the study will highlight the limitations of current approaches.

(Note: I need to rewrite this part, because it's implying I was going to do a broad survey of approaches. I ended up in another place, so I need to change this to reflect that.)

### Setting the Stage for Our Methodology
<div id="todo">
(NP: I liked what you had in the previous version here. I just realised that you have started editing :S hopefully my other comments make sense.)
</div>

In the digital era, the ways we read and interact with text are evolving rapidly, posing new challenges and opportunities for enhancing the reading experience. This study aims to bridge traditional literary methods with modern technological interventions, contributing to the dialogue about the evolution of reading. Through a combined framework of theoretical analysis and practical experimentation, this research seeks to provide actionable insights and recommendations for designers, educators, and content creators. The goal is to craft reading experiences that are both technologically enriched and deeply respectful of the literary tradition that has shaped human thought and culture for millennia.

<div id="methodology"></div>
## Methodology

### Integration of Literature and Contextual Review

Anchoring our approach in a mixed-methods framework, this research integrates a broad spectrum of academic research, industry reports, and practical applications. This foundational review informs our selection of methodologies, ensuring they address the identified gaps and leverage opportunities within the field. Insights from Nielsen on usability heuristics and Raskin on interface efficiency highlight the necessity for user-centered design, influencing our choice to use the Touch Level Model (TLM) for our comparative analysis. Moreover, Fogh's critique on the effectiveness of interactive educational tools underscores the importance of integrating explorative elements into our experiments, ensuring our methodologies are not only relevant but also adaptable to both historical precedents and contemporary advancements.

### Methodological Overview

Our mixed-methods approach begins with the Touch Level Model (TLM), an adaptation of the traditional GOMS model customized for touchscreen interactions. This model allows us to conduct a detailed comparative analysis of different reading-based interactions, such as measuring the time efficiency of accessing footnotes in print versus digital formats. Following this, we employ Nielsen's Heuristic Evaluation to assess key areas including Flow, Utility, Development Effort, and Customisation Effort, providing a qualitative measure of augmented text's design and usability. Additional analyses incorporate Raskin's Efficiency Score, Fitts' Law, and Hick's Law, further enriching our understanding of the interface intuitiveness and the cognitive load involved in making decisions within augmented texts.

### Criteria Definition

The comprehensive evaluation model developed for this research synthesizes multiple components to offer a nuanced view of augmented text. Each component—ranging from touch interaction metrics to usability heuristics—contributes unique insights into the design and functionality of augmented reading experiences. By applying these criteria, we aim to highlight the advantages and potential drawbacks of different augmented text implementations, guiding future enhancements in a manner that respects the intrinsic value of traditional reading while embracing the potential of digital innovation."

This revised flow ensures each section builds upon the previous one, eliminating redundancy and clarifying how each part of your methodology contributes to the overarching research goals. It maintains a narrative that is cohesive, logical, and reflective of your individual style, focusing on a progressive unveiling of your methodological framework.

To develop a comprehensive evaluation model for augmented text, the methodology combines several components, each contributing unique insights:

1. **Touch Level Model (TLM):** Quantifies touch interactions, providing a baseline for comparing the efficiency of gestures and taps in augmented texts. Derived from the original GOM model, see details in next section.
2. **Flow:** Measures how seamlessly users can navigate and engage with the text, emphasising the importance of a distraction-free reading experience.
3. **Utility:** Evaluates the added value of augmented features in enhancing understanding and engagement, highlighting the relevance and effectiveness of these enhancements.
4. **Development Effort:** Assesses the resources required to implement augmented features, considering both time and technical complexity.
5. **Customisation Effort:** Examines the ease with which users can personalise their reading experience, reflecting on user autonomy and adaptability.
6. **Raskin's Efficiency Measures:** Applies a broader view of information efficiency, focusing on how effectively augmented text conveys information with minimal user effort.
7. **Fitts’ Law:** Integrates principles of human motor system behavior to evaluate the physical ease of interacting with augmented text features.
8. **Hick’s Law:** Considers the cognitive load in decision-making, particularly how feature variety and complexity impact user choices and response times.

Combining these elements provides a holistic view, balancing objective performance metrics with subjective user experience assessments. This "cocktail" of data offers a nuanced understanding of augmented text's impact, guiding optimisations that enhance readability, engagement, and ease of use without compromising the essence of reading.
#### Approach
This study will analyse a variety of reading tasks 
<div id="todo">
(NP: I had in my comments of the previous version that it would be good to present your tasks here and then use the Findings section to show what you found from each task. That is the more traditional way of presenting your study and methods. You start wth the methodological approach/epistemology, then any lenses or theories that apply (you have done this) and then you present the ‘experimental’ tasks and procedure. Essentially what you did to address your research question(s))
</div>

that individuals may encounter, utilising a custom "report card" to score different approaches to augmented text. By assessing how each approach fares against specific criteria such as flow, utility, development effort, and customisation effort, the study will provide a personalised evaluation of the effectiveness of various augmented reading experiences. This method allows for a nuanced comparison of how different technologies and design choices impact the reading process.

#### Introducing TLM, an extension of GOMS
The Touch Level Model (TLM), proposed by Andrew D. Rice and Jonathan W. Lartigue in 2014, is an adaptation and extension of the GOMS model specifically designed for touchscreen interfaces. The GOMS model, developed by Card, Moran, and Newell in 1983, is a methodological framework for human-computer interaction that breaks down tasks into Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules to predict and analyse user behaviour and performance. TLM extends this framework to account for the unique gestures and actions associated with touchscreens, such as taps, swipes, and pinches, providing a quantitative analysis tool for touchscreen interface design.

The TLM introduces new operators for touchscreen interactions, including Gesture (G), Pinch (P), Zoom (Z), Tap (T), Swipe (S), and others, to model real-world distractions and the physical actions of interacting with a touchscreen device. This model aims to accurately predict user performance on touchscreen devices by benchmarking these specific interactions.

In comparison, the original GOMS model focuses on keyboard and mouse-based interfaces, using operators like keystroking (K), pointing with a mouse (P), and homing the hand on the keyboard (H). The TLM's addition of touchscreen-specific operators illustrates the evolution of user interface design from physical keyboards and mice to touchscreens, acknowledging the pervasive nature of touch-based devices in modern technology.

While GOMS provides a general framework for analysing human-computer interaction, TLM tailors this approach to the specific context of touchscreen use, reflecting the shifting landscape of device interaction methods and the need for models that can accurately predict and improve user experience in a touch-based environment.
#### Ethical Considerations

Not applicable to this study, as it does not involve human participants or data collection that raises ethical concerns.

<div id="findings"></div>
## Findings

With our key question answered, literature review completed, gaps in research identified,
<div id="todo">
(NP: I think these were not very clearly identified ;))
</div>

and mixed-method approach settled on, we did our research and analysed the results. Summaries for each comparative study are below, and the raw data for each study can be found in the appendix. Below is the high-level summary of findings.
<div id="todo">
(NP: That is good! I had in my comments that it would be good to do that but I was suggesting to do it at the end of the findings section or as a very short para at the beginning of the discussion.)
</div>

### Summary of findings
1. **Context is king**: Across the findings, we see that doing nothing to help someone understand context always tests worse than doing something. This is an unsurprising result, but leads to finding #2, with its inconvenient implications.
2. **Authoring context is extremely difficult:** In a perfect world, every word, paragraph, or full paper would always provide context that doesn't take you out of flow. But in the real world, every one of these features requires development, testing, upcoming, and training. The key here is not to build cool features, but to understand the tradeoffs inherent in creating and publishing content.
3. **We need better metrics to rate ROI:** If a feature takes a year to develop, but only saves someone twenty seconds of time, it has poor ROI. The problem is that despite my efforts here, there's no standardised way to quantify if a feature that adds helpful content could be worth it.
4. **Some things are simply not possible without augmented text:** Many of the items compared boil down to a clear comparison between task completion across two flows. But some can't be compared because it's simply not possible to do without a change in technology. This is part of the tradeoff discussion.
5. **The possibilities are vast and contextual:** I've carved off a small handful of examples to compare here, but any publication of content could come up with new features. For example, imagine tools that help understand memes, or completely different tools designed for lawyers or doctors to understand their complex fields.

### Raw graph of results
For each of the items above, I've provided a standardised reading of how each process fared in my analysis.

### Study details
<div id="word-lookup"></div>
#### Study #1: Word Lookup
<img src="media/word-lookup.png" />

#### Description
In the transition from traditional to digital mediums, the task of looking up a word has been vastly transformed. This study contrasts the process of finding a word's definition in a paperback book with the digital efficiency of iOS, Android, and Kindle platforms. The digital approach leverages rapid, in-context definition retrieval, thereby streamlining the reader's experience.

#### Result summary
Traditional methods, while straightforward, proved to be slower and labeled a 'Fail' in the context of this study. The digital methods, especially iOS, demonstrated a significant reduction in time, with a 'Pass' status. However, when words were not directly defined, as with the nonsensical words in iOS and Android, the time and effort required spiked, resulting in a 'Fail'. Kindle's X-Ray feature maintained its efficiency with both real and nonsensical words, consistently passing.


<div id="footnotes"></div>
#### Study #2: Footnotes
<img src="media/footnotes.png" />

Footnotes are essential for providing additional context and information without disrupting the main text flow. This study contrasts the traditional practice of flipping to the end of a book to read a footnote with the modern approach of popover footnotes in digital texts. The focus is on the ease and speed with which a reader can access this supplementary material.

#### Summary of results
Traditional footnotes involve a greater time investment and physical effort but have been found satisfactory in the study. Digital popover footnotes, on the other hand, significantly reduce the time to just a few seconds and provide an immediate, in-context understanding, thus passing the criteria with a notable improvement in efficiency.

#### Demo
(Removed "CitePullForward" demo for now so I can fix it)

<div id="image-comparison"></div>
#### Study #3: Image Comparison
<img src="media/image-comparison.png" />

The ability to compare images is vital for visual learning and analysis. This study examines the traditional method of comparing two images across physical pages versus the digital method using a before and after slider. The focus is on the effectiveness and efficiency of the comparison process.

#### Result summary
Traditional methods of image comparison require more time and effort as users need to flip pages back and forth. The digital method provides a significant improvement in speed, reducing the time to just a few seconds with a streamlined user experience. Both methods received a 'Pass,' indicating satisfactory results, but the digital method shines in user efficiency.
#### Demo
<BeforeAndAfterSlider format="embed" />
<div id="bookmarking"></div>
#### Study #4: Bookmarking
<img src="media/bookmarking.png" />

Remembering where one left off in a reading session is crucial for a seamless reading experience. This study compares the traditional method of mentally noting or physically marking a page with the use of a digital last read indicator. The ease and reliability of resuming a reading session are evaluated.

#### Summary of results
The traditional method shows a higher effort from the reader's side, resulting in a 'Fail' for this study. In contrast, the digital last read indicator proves to be highly efficient, allowing users to quickly and effortlessly return to their last stopping point in the text, receiving a 'Pass'.

#### Demo

## Discussion

#### Limitations and Concepts Out of Scope

**Analysis of Augmented Text**

The study examines augmented text from a theoretical perspective, prioritising a design-centric analysis over empirical data. The lack of objective task completion times and effectiveness data means that the conclusions drawn are more conceptual than quantitative, emphasising the potential and theoretical applications of augmented text features. The absence of diverse user testing leaves room for future research to explore how different user groups interact with and benefit from these text augmentations.

**Focus on Theoretical Evaluation**

By choosing to evaluate augmented text through a theoretical lens, the study emphasises the designer's intent and the anticipated user experience. This approach allows for a concentrated examination of the design principles that underpin augmented text, although it does not measure actual user interactions or satisfaction.

**Accessibility Considerations**

The principles discussed throughout the paper have profound implications for accessibility. Augmented text has the potential to significantly enhance the reading experience for users with disabilities by providing alternative ways to engage with content. However, the current study does not directly address how these technologies serve users with varying accessibility needs. By focusing the scope, the research underscores the need for specialised studies that specifically tackle accessibility in the context of augmented text, ensuring that these innovations are inclusive and beneficial for all users.

#### Credit where credit is due
My research was based on foundational insights from Chomsky’s theories on innate language structures, particularly _Syntactic Structures_ (1957) and _Aspects of the Theory of Syntax_ (1965), Wolf’s analysis of the cognitive processes involved in reading from _Proust and the Squid_ (2007), and Byrne’s exploration of the contextual impact on music from _How Music Works_ (2012). Additionally, the efforts of the HCI community, especially Nielsen’s _Usability Engineering_ (1994) and Raskin’s _The Humane Interface_ (2000), provided a comprehensive academic grounding. These insights helped me understand the human mind’s ability to hear, read, and comprehend information and the principles of successful interface design.

My research aligned well with the insights from these scholars and thinkers. In many of my comparisons, it was clear that adding context was always more helpful than not adding context, assuming the experience was usable and quick. Being able to quantify "usable" and "quick" was very helpful, thanks to the efforts of the HCI field. While I couldn't always quantify the exact effort a task might take (how long does it take to look something up in a dictionary? It depends), it was valuable to compare two experiences in a relative way. You might not always know exactly how many seconds something will take, but you can estimate the relative difficulty of two tasks based on how many steps each might take.

In the findings, looking up a word on iOS resulted in a LTM sequence of MPTMTT,

</div>

which is estimated to take 4.7 seconds. In contrast, looking up a word in a physical copy of a book isn't possible, returning an LTM sequence of MHTM[PTK]T, an estimated time of 16.4 seconds, (representing the fastest estimated time someone can quit one app and search for a definition in a dictionary app), and a failing task. This neatly demonstrates the difference between not being able to access answers or context without external help versus having context as part of the reading experience.

Now we'll try a curveball. iOS does a good job defining words when they're in the English language, but fails when it doesn't recognise a word. For example, imagine a reader is enjoying the novel Dune, and they long-press the capitalised word Adept, a term that has special meaning in the Dune literature. iOS will return the English language translation for the word, despite the capitalisation, rather than the actual definition someone is looking for when reading Dune. Worse still is what happens when you try to define a word that doesn't exist at all. If our reader attempts to look up the word Auqaf, they'll be told by iOS that the word isn't available and instead show the definition of the word "Aqua." These failures result in LTM sequences of MPTM[TPTKMPTRT]T, taking 16.95 seconds, conservatively. It could be argued that the additional confusion of expecting a result and getting the wrong one would add more cognitive load and time than simply not having the feature at all.

As a contrast, Amazon's Kindle has a feature called X-Ray that doesn't just perform a simple dictionary search on a word, it attempts to pull other context into the reading experience. Looking up the same Dune words on Kindle result in LTM sequences of MPTT and a time of 2.85 seconds, the fastest of an option by far. When reading, context is king. Any software that can provide useful context is better than software that can't, provided that it only is offered when requested. And amongst different software options that can provide differing levels of quality and speed, the right answers delivered faster will always be better than ones with bad data or that are delivered slowly.

Jon is confused here -- not sure where to put this
</div>

In the findings chart, I established a column for "developer effort" with only two options, green arrow up meaning "no big deal" or a red arrow down that means "kind of a big deal." This metric is comically, insultingly vague. The fact that everything from chatGPT's codebase to creating a simple tooltip both fall into the same category shows that this metric is meant for comparative purposes, not any kind of objective measure of difficulty. Put another way, I'm not attempting to say how hard something else, just that it's harder than the traditional way of doing it.

As a tangible example, "comparing two images across two pages" is a common action when seeing two images presented side by side, and requires no special effort from the author or developer. Therefore, it gets a green arrow pointing up. On the other hand, creating a Before and After slider isn't particularly difficult because it's such a common component. But it does take some effort to wire up, so it gets a red arrow pointing down. So these measurements provide a good comparative analysis, whereas a full accounting of exactly how complex each task may be is beyond the scope of this research.

But this metric goes beyond simple coding difficulty. We also need to factor in the complexity of a fragmenting media ecosystem, and the fact that no single entity owns the right to publish ideas on the internet. To illustrate this, let's say you wanted to argue that the Article Diff feature should exist for all media organisations. If you don't work at one, you probably won't get very far. But even if you are the CTO of the New York Times, and you successfully ship the feature to the New York Times audience, you have no control over what the Washington Post does, or the New Zealand Herald. Others may adopt your idea, but it's not really up to you. This means that no matter how good any of the ideas are that I've presented, no matter how much faster or better they are in objective ways, their reach is out of the control of any one entity. And that's a problem for improving the overall experience of reading text.

In doing my literature review, I noticed a lot of research talking about ways to make concepts such as Explorable Explanations more mainstream. 
<div id="todo">
(NP: What studies found these? Make sure you reference those. And if they are not studies, you can still discuss them but you need to be transparent about its provenance.)
</div>

A common suggestion was to make new programming languages or paradigms to help more people create helpful content to help people learn more, more effectively. But even with the best new programming language in the world, with the best tutorials, the best outreach content, the most motivated team, and the money to pay for it, it's still much harder to write code than write copy. Some organisations such as Pudding.cool and The New York Times have been able to fund this kind of work, but it's still a minority of all content. It's the opinion of the author that this is appropriate. Most reading should be reading, and even when teaching aids and illustrations are introduced, it should be the bare minimum required to get the main point across, and always something the user requests, rather than something that's pushed on them.

I want to put a very clear line in the sand here: despite all the advantages of augmented text, and in helping people add context to the content they're reading, it's still a tremendous technical challenge that is not easy to address. It won't be addressed or fixed by better programming languages or better ideas. Success of these ideas will emerge slowly and organically, in the marketplace of ideas. If a large organisation such as Wordpress decides to embrace some examples of Augmented Text, then its competitors decide to react in order to stay competitive, the ideas will spread. Slowly, and over time, some ideas might become popular enough in the mainstream. But it will take that, and nothing less than that, not a better programming language.

#### We need better metrics to rate ROI

And the discussion in papers/dissertations etc. needs to be more critical aka in this case you need to make more direct comparisons with the studies conducted by others and their results vs your results. It doesn’t need to be done for everything but for key/related pieces of existing work)
</div>

My research struggled to come up with a conceptual framework to help understand which features could benefit from improvements, and by how much. If we could quantify actions easily, like knowing that following any hyperlink took exactly 3 seconds, or researching a footnote always took 7 seconds, I'd have a more objective measure to rely on. Instead, my methodology needed to rely on relative measures. This works well when comparing traditional to traditional approaches, but doesn't work as well when determining the overall benefit of a new feature.

I'd propose a new heuristic for determining the potential success of a new approach: estimate the total number of developer hours a feature might take, and compare it to how many hours we think it will save the audience. For example, if the "Interactive Numbers" feature only requires 8 developer hours to create and implement on a site, whereas one million people would use the feature and each would save 2 minutes, that means the effort took 8 hours but saved 33,333 hours, for an ROI of 4167:1.

On the other hand, imagine if "Summarise Widget (Hard-coded)" takes a team of 12 3 months to implement, but the overall user base it's serving means that only 1000 people will see it and get 5 minutes of value each. That means the team would spend 5,760 hours building a feature that users would get 83 hours of use out of each week, for a ratio of .0145:1. At this rate, it would take 69.12 weeks for the feature to break even. On one hand, that's more than a year for the ROI to pay off. On the other hand, if that year positions your media organisation favourably, and you become known as a site that doesn't just deliver news but helps you comprehend it, maybe that's an investment worth making. But either way, it's important to quantify these ideas in a way that helps determine if they're worth it or not, in as objective a way as possible. Even the best feature in the world, which would help literally everyone who saw it, needs to justify its investment. If only 100 people will see it, but it takes a million dollars to build it, that at least needs to be built into the ROI in some tangible way.

#### Augmented text opens new doors
In the digital age, the evolution of text from static to dynamic through augmentation has opened new horizons that were previously unimaginable. Traditional text, while a cornerstone of knowledge transfer and communication for centuries, inherently possesses limitations that restrict the depth of interaction and engagement. This is where the notion that "Some Things Are Simply Not Possible Without Augmented Text" comes into play, underscoring a pivotal shift in how we perceive and interact with written content.

Augmented text transcends these limitations by embedding interactivity, multimedia, and context-aware features directly within the text, enabling a multifaceted reading experience that traditional mediums cannot offer. This enhancement is not merely about adding novelty to reading; it's about fundamentally expanding the capabilities of text to inform, educate, and engage.

One of the most significant advantages of augmented text is its ability to bridge comprehension gaps in real-time. Consider complex scientific papers or historical documents laden with specialised terminology. Without augmentation, readers might find themselves disengaged, lost in jargon that feels inaccessible. Augmented text, however, can instantly provide definitions, explanations, or visual aids at the point of need, seamlessly integrated into the reading experience. This immediacy transforms the act of reading from a passive to an interactive journey, where understanding is not just facilitated but enriched.

Augmented text also serves as a platform for creativity and exploration, enabling authors and educators to embed interactive elements, simulations, and exploratory tools within the text. This capability transforms the reading experience into an interactive journey, where readers can simulate experiments, visualise data dynamically, or explore scenarios within the narrative. Such interactivity invites readers to engage deeply with the content, fostering a more profound understanding and retention of information.

Moreover, augmented text overcomes the physical and digital boundaries that confine traditional text. Geographic and temporal constraints, which once limited the dissemination and relevance of information, are rendered moot. Augmented text can incorporate real-time data, connect readers across the globe through collaborative annotations, or update content to reflect the latest developments, ensuring the information remains relevant and timely.

Despite its potential, the widespread adoption of augmented text faces significant challenges, particularly in implementation. Developing sophisticated augmented text systems requires considerable investment in technology, design, and content creation. Moreover, the technological infrastructure to support such features must be universally accessible, posing a challenge in ensuring equitable access to the benefits of augmented text.

Looking ahead, the possibilities of augmented text are vast and largely untapped. As technology advances, we can anticipate even more innovative forms of augmentation, from augmented reality overlays that bring text to life in our physical environment to AI-driven personal assistants that provide contextual insights and support. These advancements promise to further dissolve the barriers between readers and the knowledge they seek, ushering in a new era of text that is not just read but experienced.

<div id="limitations"></div>
<div id="limitations"></div>
#### The limitations of explorable explanations
I'm just as optimistic about Bret Victor's work now as before I started my research. The idea that words are of limited value when exploring complex concepts is self evident. The advantages of a play-oriented mindset when attempting to learn a new thing is as foundational an insight as a rule of thermodynamics. Breakthrough essays like Snowfall and the resulting backlash to them stressed an idea we could feel in our bones at the time, and scientific data is merely serving to quantify a thing we know in our bones: it's not just about the information, but now well the information is presented and taught. 

It's why great teachers are so valuable, and the same applies to great books, great documentaries, great translations. To communicate clearly and effectively is next to godliness. And if it were easy, everyone would do it.  Sadly, it's not easy. And that's where the limitations of Victor and Case's work becomes evident. The techniques they propose are good in theory, but sometimes prohibitively difficult to produce. This matters, and it's what my research made clear as I compared different techniques. No matter how valuable the feature, if it too complex to make or to experience, it wouldn't matter. This is what Fogh discovered in their work, and I was able to replicate. Good ideas are good, but they need to justify the effort it takes to build and experience them.

I'm left as optimistic as ever about the idea of helping people understand complex concepts with more advanced uses of multimedia. But the future won't be full of explorable explanations, any more than the world is full of educational software. However, subtle yet powerful ways of improving core reading experience will only grow in popularity and usage. It won't be a broad, mainstream revolution where everything changes overnight. Instead, it will be the small and consistent improvements to core reading experiences over many years that will move us forward. 

<div id="possibilities"></div>

### The possibilities are vast and contextual
The exploration of augmented text thus far has only scratched the surface of its potential. By examining a select few examples, we've begun to understand its impact. However, the true breadth of possibilities it holds is as boundless as the diversity of content that exists in our world. Augmented text is not merely a tool for enhancing traditional reading experiences; it's a gateway to uncharted territories of knowledge and interaction.

Consider the realm of memes, a ubiquitous form of digital communication that blends humour, culture, and commentary. Augmented text could offer tools to dissect and understand the layers of meaning within a meme, contextualising its references and nuances for those not in the know. Such tools could transform fleeting moments of entertainment into rich, educational experiences, broadening our understanding of digital culture.

The potential applications extend far beyond popular culture, reaching into the specialised and complex worlds of various professions. For lawyers, augmented text could revolutionise the way legal documents are interacted with, offering real-time annotations, precedent references, and legal interpretations at the touch of a word. This could demystify legal language, making it more accessible to practitioners and the public alike.

In the medical field, doctors and students could benefit from augmented textbooks and journals that offer interactive diagrams, patient case studies, and the latest research findings embedded directly within the text. This could facilitate a deeper understanding of medical conditions and treatments, enhancing the learning process and ultimately improving patient care.

The possibilities are indeed vast and contextual, limited only by our imagination and the technological advancements that continue to unfold. As augmented text evolves, it promises to reshape not only how we consume information but also how we interact with the world around us. It encourages a future where knowledge is more accessible, education is more interactive, and our capacity for understanding and innovation is boundless.

This vision of the future, powered by augmented text, is not just an aspiration but a call to action for creators, developers, and thinkers. It challenges us to envision and build new ways of sharing and discovering knowledge, to transcend the limitations of traditional text, and to embrace the vast, untapped potential that lies within augmented text.

As we stand on the precipice of this new era, it's clear that the journey ahead is filled with exciting possibilities. The exploration of augmented text is a path to unlocking new dimensions of understanding and engagement, promising to enrich our lives in ways we're only beginning to imagine.

## Conclusion

<div id="further"></div>
#### Further Research

The exploration of augmented text opens avenues for enhancing accessibility, offering a transformative potential for inclusivity. Future research must delve into the integration of assistive technologies, ensuring that augmented text becomes a tool for all, breaking barriers for those with disabilities. Establishing more objective measures for evaluating augmented text's efficacy stands paramount. This involves developing metrics that go beyond subjective analysis, allowing for a quantifiable assessment of the impact on user comprehension and engagement.

Expanding the repository of augmented text features tailored for specialised fields like healthcare, education, law, and IT could revolutionise professional and academic landscapes. Such research would explore domain-specific enhancements that cater to the unique needs of each field, potentially altering how professionals engage with text-based information.

In healthcare, for instance, augmented text could enable interactive medical journals that respond to touch, providing instant visualizations of complex anatomical structures. Education could benefit from augmented textbooks that adapt to the learner's pace and style, offering personalised explanations. The legal field might see contracts that elucidate terms with a simple tap, while IT could use augmented manuals that visually guide users through troubleshooting steps.

<div id="todo">
(Edu angle, paraphrased: You can do a short discussion at the end of the discussion section and present this as next steps/ how this can be future research i.e. to look into the application of augmented text for educational contexts specifically.)
</div>


These explorations require interdisciplinary collaboration, pooling expertise from technologists, domain specialists, and educators. The goal is to create a symbiosis between text and technology that enriches, rather than dilutes, the essence of reading. Ethical considerations will be paramount, ensuring that these innovations serve to empower rather than disenfranchise.

As we embrace the digital age's challenges and opportunities, research in augmented text becomes not just an academic pursuit but a societal imperative. It's a journey towards a more enlightened, accessible, and connected world through the power of text, transformed.

## Appendix 1: Inspiration Gallery
While working on this paper, I spent a lot of time discovering work by people who understood that text could be more than text with embedded media and hyperlinks. I couldn't bear to leave them out of my research, so I've included them here for inspiration.

### Artists working with the "grain" of text

The concept of working with the grain of a medium has been a guiding principle in various artistic and communicative endeavours. It reflects an alignment with the innate tendencies and capacities of a given medium, allowing creators to craft resonant and effective experiences. However, innovation and exploration often require stepping beyond established boundaries, breaking traditional moulds, and forging new paths. This adventurous spirit of exploration can lead to groundbreaking works that redefine our understanding of the medium itself.

**Breaking the Mould: "House of Leaves"**

An exemplary case of breaking outside the bounds of traditional artistic forms is Mark Z. Danielewski's novel "House of Leaves." Unlike the vast majority of books that can be easily transformed into ePubs or other digital formats, "House of Leaves" defies simple categorisation. It plays with visual design, page numbers, colours, and special codes, making it closer to an artistic artefact than a simple book. As Danielewski says:

> *Books don't have to be so limited. They can intensify informational content and experience. Multiple stories can lie side by side on the page.. Words can also be colored and those colors can have meaning. How quickly pages are turned or not turned can be addressed. Hell pages can be tilted, turned upside down, even read backwards... But here's the joke. Books have had this capacity all along... Books are remarkable constructions with enormous possibilities... But somehow the analogue powers of these wonderful bundles of paper have been for- gotten. Somewhere along the way, all its possibilities were denied. I'd like to see that perception change. I'd like to see the book reintroduced for all it really is.*

(Hansen, 2004)

The novel's complex layout and multifaceted narrative structure are integral to the reading experience, and they cannot be replicated in standard digital formats. Footnotes lead to appendices, mirrored text demands physical interaction, and different fonts and colours signify various layers of the story. This design goes against the grain of traditional book publishing, turning the physical book into a part of the narrative itself.

This deliberate choice to defy the conventional grain of book design has led to a unique and immersive reading experience, one that challenges readers' expectations and engages them on a deeper level. "House of Leaves" is not just a novel; it is a literary labyrinth that invites exploration, reflection, and active participation.

**Adapting to the Environment: "How Music Works"**

In his 2012 book "How Music Works," David Byrne explores how different kinds of music are impacted by the environment. He illustrates how musical compositions have evolved to reflect the characteristics of the spaces in which they are performed. From grand concert halls to intimate chambers, from boomboxes to headphones, music has adapted to resonate with the grain of the listening experience. 

Byrne's insights reveal how understanding and aligning with the grain of the environment can lead to powerful and harmonious musical expressions. The art is not only in crafting the song but also in understanding the "concert hall" it will be played in.

**Nicky Case:**

Nicky Case’s work epitomizes the power of interactive storytelling. Through projects like "Loopy", Case has demonstrated how complex systems and ideas can be conveyed through playful, interactive models. Loopy, for instance, allows users to create and play with dynamic systems, making the abstract concepts of feedback loops and systemic behaviours accessible and understandable. Nicky Case’s creations are not just about passive consumption of information, but about fostering a deeper understanding through interaction and exploration. This approach breaks down the barriers of complexity, making learning a fun and engaging endeavour. (Case, n.d.)

**Integration of Nicky Case's Work into Augmented Text**

Nicky Case's explorables, like "Parable of the Polygons" and "Loopy," embody the essence of augmented text by transforming static narratives into interactive experiences. These explorables are not merely embedded media; they are synergistic with the text, enhancing and expanding upon the written word without overshadowing it. This integration aligns perfectly with the goal of augmented text, which seeks to create a seamless blend of textual and interactive elements. By incorporating these explorables into the narrative, they serve as a bridge between traditional text and modern multimedia, creating a richer, more engaging reader experience.

Case’s work is exemplary in demonstrating the power of interactive storytelling. "Parable of the Polygons" is particularly relevant, using simple shapes and movements to illuminate complex social issues such as segregation and diversity. This interactive model allows users to engage with the content at a deeper level, manipulating variables and witnessing the immediate consequences of their actions. It's a poignant example of how augmented text can elevate understanding through participation.

Similarly, "Loopy" invites users to create and manipulate systems, learning through doing. It's a tool that encourages exploration and experimentation, key aspects of learning that are often undervalued in traditional text. By pulling these examples into the pattern library, your thesis not only acknowledges their value but also provides a framework for others to build upon.

As augmented text seeks to make information more accessible and engaging, Case's explorables serve as a beacon, showing how complex concepts can be distilled into interactive, understandable formats. The challenge lies in analysing these works to extract underlying principles that can be applied broadly to augmented text. It's about finding the balance between the illustrative power of interactivity and the clarity and brevity of the text. Case’s explorables do not replace the text; they enhance it, providing a model for augmented text that is both informative and captivating.

By incorporating these explorables into your thesis, you are not only acknowledging the work of a pioneer in interactive storytelling but also laying the groundwork for future explorations into augmented text. It's a testament to the power of interactivity as a complement to traditional writing, and a step towards a more dynamic, engaging form of communication.

Nicky Case's work is indispensable for the exploration of augmented text. These interactive narratives are more than mere examples; they are the embodiment of the potential that augmented text holds. They show how text can evolve beyond the page, becoming a dynamic tool for education, understanding, and engagement. By integrating these works into your thesis, you highlight the future possibilities of text and set a standard for others to follow.

**Google's interactive explorables**

The exploration of Google's interactive explorables presents an opportunity to observe how a tech giant interprets and applies the concept of augmented text. Their explorables page is a showcase of how interactive elements can be seamlessly integrated with textual information to enhance the user's understanding and engagement. This section will delve into specific examples from Google's repository (Google, n.d.) that embody the principles of augmented text and how they can be applied to educational and informational content.

Google's approach to machine learning visualization is particularly noteworthy. By allowing users to adjust data points and instantly see the algorithm’s response, these explorables simplify the complexities of AI, making them approachable for non-experts. The immediate feedback provided by these tools exemplifies how augmented text can transform the reader's role from passive recipient to active participant.

Another feature worth highlighting is the "scroll through time" function, which offers a dynamic means to visualize change and development. This interactive timeline could serve as a model for illustrating the evolution of communication technologies in your thesis, offering readers a vivid understanding of historical transformations.

These examples of Google's explorables could serve as prototypes for augmented text within the thesis, illustrating the potential of interactive elements to enrich educational narratives. By discussing these tools, the thesis can demonstrate the practical applications of augmented text in simplifying and elucidating complex concepts. This analysis will also provide insights into the design principles that make these explorables effective, such as their intuitive interfaces and the balance between interactivity and informational content.

Through the inclusion of Google's explorables, your thesis can present a compelling argument for the integration of interactive media into traditional text, suggesting a future where digital communication is not only informative but also engaging and interactive. The section will conclude with a critical reflection on how these examples can inform the development of a pattern library for augmented text, which other researchers and practitioners can reference and expand upon.

**Incorporating Bartosz Ciechanowski's Work into Augmented Text**

Bartosz Ciechanowski's site provides an impressive list of interactive articles (Ciechanowski, n.d.) that exemplify the principles of augmented text. His approach to explaining complex topics through interactive graphics and intuitive explanations sets a benchmark for what augmented text can achieve. This section will explore how his work can be dissected to inform and inspire the pattern library of augmented text within the thesis.

Ciechanowski's articles, such as those elucidating the mechanics of cameras or the intricacies of internal combustion engines, go beyond mere illustration; they invite readers to interact with the concepts being discussed. This interactivity transforms the reader's experience from static absorption to dynamic exploration, a key characteristic of augmented text. By manipulating the elements within the articles, readers gain a hands-on understanding, which can be particularly effective for educational purposes.

The relevance of these articles to the thesis lies in their ability to demystify complex subjects, making them accessible to a broader audience. This is achieved not through oversimplification but through the power of interactive visualizations that work in concert with the written content. Each article presents an opportunity to analyze how text and interactive elements can be blended to create an enhanced reading experience.

As the thesis advocates for augmented text as a means of responsive communication, Ciechanowski's work can serve as a case study for implementing such principles effectively. It demonstrates how augmented text can provide clarity and insight into topics that might otherwise be impenetrable to those without specialized knowledge. The integration of these examples into the thesis will not only support the argument for augmented text but will also provide a practical framework for its application.

This exploration will culminate in a discussion of the design and educational philosophies underpinning Ciechanowski's work. The insights gleaned from this analysis will contribute to the development of a set of guidelines for creating augmented text, ensuring that such text is not only informative but also engaging and capable of fostering a deeper level of understanding.

By examining the archives of Ciechanowski, the thesis will bridge the gap between theoretical exploration and practical application, illustrating how augmented text can be used to create powerful and educational narratives. The section will underscore the importance of such work in the evolution of digital communication, positioning it as an integral component of the pattern library that others can draw upon for their own explorations of augmented text.

**"Homestuck": A Multi-Modal Marvel**

Andrew Hussie's 'Homestuck' (Hussie, n.d.) is a webcomic that delights in transcending traditional boundaries and defying categorisation. It is a unique blend of illustration, text, interactive games, and videos, creating a multi-modal experience that engages readers on multiple levels. The narrative is not confined to static images and words on a page; it spills into interactive Flash games, YouTube videos, and even physical merchandise. Hussie's creation doesn't just adhere to the grain of conventional storytelling but revels in exploring the myriad possibilities of digital media. This makes "Homestuck" not merely a webcomic but an expansive narrative universe that invites active participation and exploration.

**Web Alternate Reality Games (ARGs)**

The concept of web Alternate Reality Games (ARGs) further expands on this idea of multi-modal storytelling. ARGs blur the lines between fiction and reality, offering immersive experiences that extend beyond traditional media. Players interact with the game through various channels such as websites, social media, phone calls, and real-world events. Clues are dropped everywhere, and players must actively engage with the content, often collaborating with others, to unravel the story. The game is not confined to a single platform or format; it permeates the player's reality, turning the entire world into a playground.

**"LOST": Transmedia Storytelling**

The popular TV show "LOST" explored this space of transmedia storytelling by creating an ARG that accompanied the series. Beyond the television screen, "LOST" fans could delve into websites, fake commercials, and other media that expanded the show's universe. These additional layers of content provided deeper insights into the characters and mysteries of the show, allowing fans to actively participate in the narrative. This approach went against the grain of traditional television watching, turning passive viewers into active participants in a broader storytelling experience. Miller, Vandome, and McBrewster (2009) have explored the ways that internet culture and interactivity began influencing our media landscape in the new century, a trend that has only accelerated since then.

**The New Horizon:**

The initiatives by Google, Nicky Case, Bartosz Ciechanowski, and the broader movement towards Explorable Explanations and Multiverses herald a new era of communication and education. They challenge the status quo, inviting us to reimagine how we interact with information and ideas. It's a shift from static to dynamic, from passive to active, and from siloed to interconnected. As we step into this new horizon, the potential for creating more engaging, insightful, and impactful learning experiences is boundless. These innovations are not just a glimpse into the future of education and communication; they are a call to action for creators, educators, and learners to embrace the interactive, exploratory nature of the digital realm.

The storytelling approaches in "Homestuck" and "LOST" ARGs demonstrate a multi-modal narrative experience that transcends traditional media boundaries. Augmented Text aligns with this innovative spirit but remains anchored in the written word. It takes cues from these multi-modal approaches to create a layered narrative experience, where text is not just a vessel for story but an active participant in the narrative journey. Augmented Text, in this context, becomes a medium where the storytelling grain is both respected and expanded, offering new dimensions to narrative construction and reader engagement.

**Tying It All Together**

Both "Homestuck" and the ARG elements of "LOST" represent a new frontier in storytelling, one that embraces the interconnectedness and flexibility of modern media. They demonstrate that the grain of storytelling is not fixed or rigid but can be shaped, stretched, and reimagined to create rich and engaging experiences. By weaving together various media and allowing readers or viewers to actively engage with the content, creators can build immersive worlds that transcend the limitations of traditional formats. This multi-modal approach to storytelling is not just an innovation; it's a celebration of the endless possibilities of artistic expression in the digital age. Whether through the sprawling narrative of "Homestuck" or the layered mystery of "LOST," these works challenge us to rethink what storytelling can be and invite us to participate in shaping its future.

As we embrace the new horizon of digital interactivity and exploration heralded by the works of Google, Nicky Case, and others, Augmented Text stands as a testament to this evolving landscape. It represents a synthesis of these innovative approaches, offering a unique blend of interactivity and traditional reading. Augmented Text is not just a continuation of the digital evolution in communication and education; it's a leap forward, offering a medium that is dynamic, interactive, and deeply connected to the evolving needs and habits of its audience.
