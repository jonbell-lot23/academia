# Augmented Text

<div id="abstract"></div>
## Abstract

**What is Augmented Text?**

Traditional reading is an analog experience, with no interactivity. Interactive software can help people learn, but can also make it hard to stay focused and in flow as you might in a book. Augmented Text aims to take the best from both worlds.

**Research Objective**

This work addresses one question: How can we enhance the reading experience through technology without compromising the essence of traditional reading? It utilities a methodology that combines qualitative and quantitative approaches in order to quantify the "essence" of traditional reading with enhancements that benefit readers of educational and informational content.

## Introduction

#### Reading is not natural, and comprehension is hard
The work "Proust and the Squid" (Wolf, 2007) explores the intricate cognitive processes involved in reading and understanding text. Wolf's analysis reveals that reading is not an innate human ability but a complex skill that our brains have adapted to perform over thousands of years, fundamentally changing the way we think, communicate, and perceive the world. Wolf asserts that reading, as opposed to simply hearing words, activates a unique interplay of brain circuits, fostering deeper comprehension and critical thinking. This is in stark contrast to oral traditions, which Noam Chomsky (1957, 1959) and others have established are innate to the human experience, and require less effort to master.

Because comprehending the written word is such a specialised process, humankind has long-relied on tools and intermediaries to make sense of what they read. Educational institutions and religious organisations have historically played crucial roles in facilitating deeper understanding and interpretation of written material. This reliance on intermediaries can be traced back to ancient times, where scribes in organised religions transcribed sacred texts to make them more accessible to a wider audience (Abdelhamid, 2022), and the establishment of universities during the medieval period further exemplified the importance of intermediaries in the dissemination of knowledge (Parhan, M., Nugraha, R., & Islamy, M., 2022). These intermediaries have been instrumental in fostering environments where comprehension and critical thinking are cultivated, echoing McLuhan's assertion that "the medium is the message" (McLuhan, 1962), highlighting how the method of communication itself influences the message received by the audience. The musician David Byrne reached similar conclusions in his book How Music Works (Byrne, 2012). From concert hall to legendary New York City Club CBGBs to headphones, he explores how music product has changed based on the context of where people will listen to it.

Together, these sources illustrate the complex interplay between content, the mediums through which it is delivered, and the intermediaries that facilitate its comprehension, underscoring the societal emphasis on understanding beyond mere experience. We don't read to to have read, we read to understand. And yet traditional books do nothing to help a reader understand beyond the scope of the material itself. 

#### Software can help with comprehension, but adds complexity
With the development of the printing press and then the internet, the volume of things to read and experience increased exponentially, but our tools for comprehension haven't kept pace. Imagine a library with 5 books and an experienced educator that can teach your their contents effectively, and compare that to a library with 10,000 books but they're all too advanced to comprehend. 

Intermediaries have attempted to address this gap between reading and comprehension for hundreds of years. In contemporary life, media organisations use multimedia such as audio and video or educational software to explain concepts. In fact, "explainer" articles and videos have seen a rise in popularity, alongside interactive data visualisations and simulations. While this has happened, the rise of more shallow reading patterns in the digital age has brought up questions about the potential impact on deep thinking, understanding, and comprehension (Delgado & Salmerón, 2021; Nkonko et al., 2019). We've never had more media to consume, and more ways to understand it, leading to a bounty of opportunity but also a feeling of overwhelm (Komljenovič, 2021). We have more ways than ever to be helped, but are those helpful features distracting from the essence and comprehension of a traditional reading experience? If so, are we losing something in our ability to think deeply? Would the great thinkers of the past have made as much progress if they had Slack notifications enabled, 83 tabs calling for their attention, and TikTok a tap away?

Explorable Explanations (Victor, 2011) and Active Essays (Kay, 2003) are pioneering examples of how text can be "augmented" to offer more interactive and immersive learning experiences, designed to assist with deeper levels of thinking and comprehension. These innovations allow readers to engage with content in dynamic ways, enabling a deeper exploration of topics and concepts through interactive visuals, simulations, and embedded coding environments. However, this evolution towards increasingly feature-rich digital texts brings forth a critical question: at what point does the augmentation of books with software and interactive elements detract from the essence of traditional reading?

"The Web's Grain," a critique on digital text design by Frank Chimero, serves as a cautionary reference point, highlighting the potential pitfalls of over-augmentation. It suggests that there exists a delicate balance between enhancing the readability and educational value of text through digital means and preserving the core experience of reading that books have offered for centuries (Chimero, 2015). The challenge lies in integrating technological advancements in a way that complements rather than overwhelms the fundamental nature of reading, ensuring that books retain their intrinsic value as a medium for thought, reflection, and learning in the digital age. The much-celebrated and awared "Snowfall" from the New York Times (2012) exemplifies a successful integration of multimedia elements into narrative content, offering a model for how augmented text can enhance storytelling without compromising the reading experience.

## Literature Review

#### What prior research has found

Between Wolf, Chomsky, and many others, we have ample academic grounding to understand much about the ability of the human mind to hear, read, and comprehend information. Thanks to the efforts of the HCI community, especially Nielsen (1994) and Raskin (2000), we have plenty of data about what makes an interface successful, or indeed in the words of Raskin, what makes it not just a "human interface" but a "humane" one. And due to the efforts of educational theorists like Dewey (1938) and Vygotsky (1978), we know what aids reading comprehension both in and outside the classroom. And yet, despite the depth of research found across these fields, it was harder to find the same rich academic research in the overlap between these three broad categories.

One bright spot I found was Bret Victor's Explorable Explanations, which inspired a cottage industry of works animated by his core concepts. This work was the original aim of my research, included in my original proposal, because I believed that his vision of augmenting text with bits of software to help comprehension was worthy of study and iteration. Could the concepts in Explorable Explanations be that blend of traditional reading and educational software that hit the sweet spot?

**What are Explorable Explanations?**

Bret Victor introduced Explorable Explanations to the world in 2011 with this definition:

> Explorable Explanations is my umbrella project for ideas that enable and encourage  truly active reading. The goal is to change people's relationship with text. People  currently think of text as information to be consumed. I want text to be used as an  environment to think in.

His introductory blog post then goes on to share several examples, which mostly present themselves as embedded educational software on a webpage. So rather than reading an essay on how electricity works, you'd instead engage with a multimedia experience that walked you through the concepts with a game-like level of interactivity.

Nicky Case created a website for tracking Explorable Explanations, where the definition for Explorable Explanations is listed thusly:

>"In short, by "explorable explanation" we mean something that 1) teaches something, and 2) is more interactive than a boring ol' quiz with only one right answer."

Other researchers have found these definitions helpful, to a point, but still vague. In the work "Explorable Explanations: What are they? What do they explain? How do we work with them? Let's find out," (2018), Fogh attempts to sort out a more firm definition, first by analysing Victor's initial defintion:

> \[...\] there seems to be only one main thread: interactivity. \[...\] However, what Victor means by text is not necessarily clear. Interestingly, he also talks of active ​reading​, as if reading is a necessity to  explorables. This would seem to put it more in the realm of interactive narratives, except within non-fiction. 

They then turn to Case's definition and finds it vague as well.

> In Case's definition interaction is included as one of only two criteria, but he is not very specific about what kind of interaction. \[...\] Case's definition also relies on the unspecific word "something". Looking at the examples on \[their\] page, it seems we are dealing with digital artefacts, but this definition does not wish to make this clear. 

With a little jab at the lack of definition, Fogh throws some academic shade when wondering with wry exasperation if a birch tree could be considered an explorable explanation:

> \[...\] the definition is broad enough that it might even include a birch tree, since I cannot confidently state that birch trees are not things that teach something by being more interactive than a boring ol' quiz.  

Fogh references a third quote about Explorable Explanations, from data journalist 
Maarten Lambrechts, who defined the concept in this way:

> "Explorable explanations (you could also call them dynamic texts or dynamic  documents) are documents users can interact with. They educate people not by just  combining text and static graphics, but by integrating interactives. So people can  really play with what they’re learning; with what they’re seeing. People can learn  something without realising they are learning something." (Lambrechts, 2018)

Fogh finds this expanded definition helpful, especially the addition of the concept of play, but is curious about the "stealth learning" angle Lambrechts mentions.

> Finally, in Lambrechts' definition, the term explorable explanations is described as interchangeable with dynamic documents or dynamic texts. Integral to his definition is also the inclusion of interactivity. He goes as far as using the word "play" to describe how the users can engage with the document and its educational content. This playing with the content seems to mirror Victor's notion of explorables as "an environment to think in" (Victor, 2011). However, Lambrechts also seems to feel that explorable explanations are closer to stealth learning games, such as Machineers (Lode et al., 2013), than to overt educational games, when he describes them as teaching without the player knowing that they are being taught.

Fogh went further than anyone else to date at trying to quantify exactly what Explorable Explanations meant, but was left as confused as me. Interactivity, play, and innovation all seemed to play a role. I appreciated the drive towards making a "better" reading and learning experience for people, but who decides what better is? How can it be quantified? How can we determine the return on investment building a feature like this? Unfortunately, Fogh ran into a dead end on these questions, citing them as out of scope for his work.

>Back in 2007, Egenfeldt-Nielsen (2007) lamented that not a lot of studies have been done in the efficiency of educational games. I would argue that the same holds today for explorable explanations. Now that a first step has been taken in identifying the genre, the next step should be to see whether explorables are actually capable of educating players. With Bad News, a game about fake news, Rozenbeek and van der Linden (2018) have attempted to do just that by including a survey as part of the experience. This is one way to approach the issue, but there are surely other, more qualitative ways of doing so.

Surely there are. And that's what I'm hoping to explore and explain, so to speak.
#### The central question we're looking to address

> How much can we enhance the reading experience through technology without compromising the essence of traditional reading?

This inquiry seeks to find a sweet spot between software and traditional books, where the augmentation of text with digital tools enriches the reader's engagement and understanding without eroding the fundamental experience of reading—a practice deeply rooted in human culture and cognitive processes.

To address this, the research will explore a spectrum of experiences that range from the simplicity of traditional books to the complexity of experimental interactive software. This exploration aims to identify strategies and methodologies that preserve the core of reading while leveraging the potential of modern technology to make texts more accessible, interactive, and engaging. By examining instances where multimedia integration has either stalled or failed to enhance the reading experience, such as in the stagnation of multimedia or the limited impact of games in this context, the study will highlight the limitations of current approaches.

(Note: I need to rewrite this part, because it's implying I was going to do a broad survey of approaches. I ended up in another place, so I need to change this to reflect that.)

#### Setting the stage for our methodology

Through a methodological framework that includes both theoretical analysis and practical experimentation, this study aims to contribute to the ongoing dialogue about the evolution of reading in the digital era. It will seek to offer insights and recommendations for designers, educators, and content creators on how to craft reading experiences that are both enriched by technology and deeply respectful of the literary tradition that has shaped human thought and culture for millennia.

## Methodology

#### Methodological Overview
This work employs a mixed-methods approach. First, it uses the Touch Level Model (TLM) for comparative analysis of different reading-based interactions, such as the scoring of the relative time it takes to access a footnote in print versus digital formats. The TLM, an adaptation of the GOMS model tailored for touchscreen interfaces, introduces specific operators for touch interactions, enhancing the GOMS framework to better suit modern device usage (Rice, A. D., & Lartigue, J., 2014).

Next, Nielsen's Heuristic Evaluation is utilised to assess four key areas: Flow, Utility, Development Effort, and Customisation Effort. These metrics provide a qualitative measure of the augmented text's design and usability (Nielsen, J., 1994). Further analysis includes Raskin's Efficiency Score, which focuses on interface intuitiveness and user efficiency (Raskin, J., 2000), Fitts' Law, addressing the time to reach a target area (Fitts, P. M., 1954), and Hick's Law, which deals with the time it takes to make a decision based on the number of choices (Hick, W. E., 1952).

By scoring interactions across these multiple heuristics, we aim to provide a comprehensive evaluation that highlights the pros and cons of each approach.
#### Criteria Definition
To develop a comprehensive evaluation model for augmented text, the methodology combines several components, each contributing unique insights:

1. **Touch Level Model (TLM):** Quantifies touch interactions, providing a baseline for comparing the efficiency of gestures and taps in augmented texts. Derived from the original GOM model, see details in next section.
2. **Flow:** Measures how seamlessly users can navigate and engage with the text, emphasising the importance of a distraction-free reading experience.
3. **Utility:** Evaluates the added value of augmented features in enhancing understanding and engagement, highlighting the relevance and effectiveness of these enhancements.
4. **Development Effort:** Assesses the resources required to implement augmented features, considering both time and technical complexity.
5. **Customisation Effort:** Examines the ease with which users can personalise their reading experience, reflecting on user autonomy and adaptability.
6. **Raskin's Efficiency Measures:** Applies a broader view of information efficiency, focusing on how effectively augmented text conveys information with minimal user effort.
7. **Fitts’ Law:** Integrates principles of human motor system behavior to evaluate the physical ease of interacting with augmented text features.
8. **Hick’s Law:** Considers the cognitive load in decision-making, particularly how feature variety and complexity impact user choices and response times.

Combining these elements provides a holistic view, balancing objective performance metrics with subjective user experience assessments. This "cocktail" of data offers a nuanced understanding of augmented text's impact, guiding optimisations that enhance readability, engagement, and ease of use without compromising the essence of reading.
#### Approach
This study will analyse a variety of reading tasks that individuals may encounter, utilising a custom "report card" to score different approaches to augmented text. By assessing how each approach fares against specific criteria such as flow, utility, development effort, and customisation effort, the study will provide a personalised evaluation of the effectiveness of various augmented reading experiences. This method allows for a nuanced comparison of how different technologies and design choices impact the reading process.

#### Introducing TLM, an extension of GOMS
The Touch Level Model (TLM), proposed by Andrew D. Rice and Jonathan W. Lartigue in 2014, is an adaptation and extension of the GOMS model specifically designed for touchscreen interfaces. The GOMS model, developed by Card, Moran, and Newell in 1983, is a methodological framework for human-computer interaction that breaks down tasks into Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules to predict and analyse user behaviour and performance. TLM extends this framework to account for the unique gestures and actions associated with touchscreens, such as taps, swipes, and pinches, providing a quantitative analysis tool for touchscreen interface design.

The TLM introduces new operators for touchscreen interactions, including Gesture (G), Pinch (P), Zoom (Z), Tap (T), Swipe (S), and others, to model real-world distractions and the physical actions of interacting with a touchscreen device. This model aims to accurately predict user performance on touchscreen devices by benchmarking these specific interactions.

In comparison, the original GOMS model focuses on keyboard and mouse-based interfaces, using operators like keystroking (K), pointing with a mouse (P), and homing the hand on the keyboard (H). The TLM's addition of touchscreen-specific operators illustrates the evolution of user interface design from physical keyboards and mice to touchscreens, acknowledging the pervasive nature of touch-based devices in modern technology.

While GOMS provides a general framework for analysing human-computer interaction, TLM tailors this approach to the specific context of touchscreen use, reflecting the shifting landscape of device interaction methods and the need for models that can accurately predict and improve user experience in a touch-based environment.
#### Limitations and Concepts Out of Scope

**Analysis of Augmented Text**

The study examines augmented text from a theoretical perspective, prioritising a design-centric analysis over empirical data. The lack of objective task completion times and effectiveness data means that the conclusions drawn are more conceptual than quantitative, emphasising the potential and theoretical applications of augmented text features. The absence of diverse user testing leaves room for future research to explore how different user groups interact with and benefit from these text augmentations.

**Focus on Theoretical Evaluation**

By choosing to evaluate augmented text through a theoretical lens, the study emphasises the designer's intent and the anticipated user experience. This approach allows for a concentrated examination of the design principles that underpin augmented text, although it does not measure actual user interactions or satisfaction.

**Accessibility Considerations**

The principles discussed throughout the paper have profound implications for accessibility. Augmented text has the potential to significantly enhance the reading experience for users with disabilities by providing alternative ways to engage with content. However, the current study does not directly address how these technologies serve users with varying accessibility needs. By focusing the scope, the research underscores the need for specialised studies that specifically tackle accessibility in the context of augmented text, ensuring that these innovations are inclusive and beneficial for all users.

#### Ethical Considerations

Not applicable to this study, as it does not involve human participants or data collection that raises ethical concerns.

## Findings

With our key question answered, literature review completed, gaps in research identified, and mixed-method approach settled on, we did our research and analysed the results. Summaries for each comparative study are below, and the raw data for each study can be found in the appendix. Below is the high-level summary of findings.

### Summary of findings
1. **Context is king**: Across the findings, we see that doing nothing to help someone understand context always tests worse than doing something. This is an unsurprising result, but leads to finding #2, with its inconvenient implications.
2. **Authoring context is extremely difficult:** In a perfect world, every word, paragraph, or full paper would always provide context that doesn't take you out of flow. But in the real world, every one of these features requires development, testing, upcoming, and training. The key here is not to build cool features, but to understand the tradeoffs inherent in creating and publishing content.
3. **We need better metrics to rate ROI:** If a feature takes a year to develop, but only saves someone twenty seconds of time, it has poor ROI. The problem is that despite my efforts here, there's no standardised way to quantify if a feature that adds helpful content could be worth it.
4. **Some things are simply not possible without augmented text:** Many of the items compared boil down to a clear comparison between task completion across two flows. But some can't be compared because it's simply not possible to do without a change in technology. This is part of the tradeoff discussion.
5. **The possibilities are vast and contextual:** I've carved off a small handful of examples to compare here, but any publication of content could come up with new features. For example, imagine tools that help understand memes, or completely different tools designed for lawyers or doctors to understand their complex fields.

### Study details
<div id="word-lookup"></div>
#### Study #1: Word Lookup
<img src="media/word-lookup.png" />

#### Description
In the transition from traditional to digital mediums, the task of looking up a word has been vastly transformed. This study contrasts the process of finding a word's definition in a paperback book with the digital efficiency of iOS, Android, and Kindle platforms. The digital approach leverages rapid, in-context definition retrieval, thereby streamlining the reader's experience.

#### Result summary
Traditional methods, while straightforward, proved to be slower and labeled a 'Fail' in the context of this study. The digital methods, especially iOS, demonstrated a significant reduction in time, with a 'Pass' status. However, when words were not directly defined, as with the nonsensical words in iOS and Android, the time and effort required spiked, resulting in a 'Fail'. Kindle's X-Ray feature maintained its efficiency with both real and nonsensical words, consistently passing.


<div id="footnotes"></div>
#### Study #2: Footnotes
<img src="media/footnotes.png" />

Footnotes are essential for providing additional context and information without disrupting the main text flow. This study contrasts the traditional practice of flipping to the end of a book to read a footnote with the modern approach of popover footnotes in digital texts. The focus is on the ease and speed with which a reader can access this supplementary material.

#### Summary of results
Traditional footnotes involve a greater time investment and physical effort but have been found satisfactory in the study. Digital popover footnotes, on the other hand, significantly reduce the time to just a few seconds and provide an immediate, in-context understanding, thus passing the criteria with a notable improvement in efficiency.

#### Demo

<div id="image-comparison"></div>
#### Study #3: Image Comparison
<img src="media/image-comparison.png" />

The ability to compare images is vital for visual learning and analysis. This study examines the traditional method of comparing two images across physical pages versus the digital method using a before and after slider. The focus is on the effectiveness and efficiency of the comparison process.

#### Result summary
Traditional methods of image comparison require more time and effort as users need to flip pages back and forth. The digital method provides a significant improvement in speed, reducing the time to just a few seconds with a streamlined user experience. Both methods received a 'Pass,' indicating satisfactory results, but the digital method shines in user efficiency.
#### Demo

<div id="bookmarking"></div>
#### Study #4: Bookmarking
<img src="media/bookmarking.png" />

Remembering where one left off in a reading session is crucial for a seamless reading experience. This study compares the traditional method of mentally noting or physically marking a page with the use of a digital last read indicator. The ease and reliability of resuming a reading session are evaluated.

#### Summary of results
The traditional method shows a higher effort from the reader's side, resulting in a 'Fail' for this study. In contrast, the digital last read indicator proves to be highly efficient, allowing users to quickly and effortlessly return to their last stopping point in the text, receiving a 'Pass'.

#### Demo
(Removed "LastReadIndicator" demo for now so I can fix it)
<div id="reference-tracking"></div>
#### Study #5: Reference Tracking
<img src="media/reference-tracking.png" />

In the digital age, managing multiple references efficiently is vital. This study evaluates the traditional method of remembering an old tab against the modern solution of reference labels. The focus is on the user's ability to maintain their train of thought and navigate between resources effectively.

#### Summary of results
The traditional method of recalling previous tabs proved to be inefficient, receiving a 'Fail' status. Meanwhile, the digital approach of using reference labels significantly improved navigation, allowing quick access to previously visited materials, which was reflected in a 'Pass' outcome.

#### Demo

## Discussion

<div id="credit"></div>
### Credit where credit is due
My research was based on foundational insights from Chomsky, Wolf, Byrne, and the efforts of the HCI community, particularly Neilson and Raskin. These insights provided a comprehensive academic grounding to understand the ability of the human mind to hear, read, and comprehend information, the principles of successful interface design, and the aids for reading comprehension both in and outside the classroom.

My research aligned well with the insights from these scholars and thinkers. In many of my comparisons, it was clear that adding context was always more helpful than not adding context, assuming the experience was usable and quick. Being able to quantify "usable" and "quick" was very helpful, thanks to the efforts of the HCI field. While I couldn't always quantify the exact effort a task might take (how long does it take to look something up in a dictionary? It depends), it was valuable to compare two experiences in a relative way. You might not always know exactly how many seconds something will take, but you can estimate the relative difficulty of two tasks based on how many steps each might take.

<div id="context"></div>
### Context is king
This work has studied how much we can enhance the reading experience without compromising the essence of traditional reading. which implies that help is always better than no help in this context. It's a statement so obvious as to seem trite, but it will be the foundation we build our entire discussion and further works on, so it's worth stress testing it a bit before we proceed. We need to confirm: is more help always better?

To illustrate, let's imagine you find a book in a store off Cuba Street in Wellington, New Zealand. You flip open the first pages and spot this introductory passage:

> There are two questions which I would like to begin with. First, what kind of critical and inventive thinking is required to take the various movements in software forward into those areas which are necessary if software oIigopoIies are to be undermined? But further, how are we to develop the capacity for unleashing the unexpected upon software and the certainties which form it?

Imagine you understand the passage perfectly, and need no assistance understanding any of the vocabulary or concepts. If that were the case, you might be puzzled by a second paragraph directly after the first one, perhaps saying something like this:

>*(In case you didn't understand the prior passage, it's asking two things: First, what smart ideas do we need to make software better and challenge big companies? Second, how can we make software more surprising?)*

Or what if there was a follow-up paragraph in another language, such as:

>*(In case you wanted to read the above passage in Maori: E rua nga pātai e hiahia ana ahau ki te tīmata. Tuatahi, he aha te momo whakaaro takenui me te waihanga e hiahiatia ana hei tango i ngā momo nekeneke i roto i ngā pūmanawa whakamua ki aua wāhi e hiahiatia ana mēnā me whakararuraru ngā pūmanawa oIigopoIies? Engari anō, me pēhea tātau e whakawhanake ai i te kaha mō te tuku i te ohorere ki ngā pūmanawa me ngā mea e hanga ana?)*

If you didn't ask for a simplified English or a Maori version, the additional help wouldn't seem like help at all. It would instead feel like clutter or an annoyance getting in the way of your main goal, reading the text. This is a clear demonstration of why help, when not asked for, might not be helpful at all.

But what about someone in the opposite situation? What if they read the above passage and didn't know what the word "oIigopoIies" means? What then? That's where help is valuable. Maybe they ask their friend, who accurately defines what the word means, but the meaning of the text still escapes comprehension. What is a "software oIigopoIy?" Why should they be undermined? Perhaps they do a search on Google for "[software oligopolies](https://www.google.com/search?q=software+oIigopoIies)," where as of the writing of this text in February 2024, Google returns no valuable context, believing instead that I meant to search for "software logos" or "software tipos."

Maybe they buy the book to ask their professor about it the next day, who can accurately explain the word, the implication behind "software oIigopoIies," the main thrust of the argument, and why the author might be arguing for them to be undermined. But that's less likely than what most people do: we notice words or concepts that we don't understand, but we don't take special action to learn them. We might be curious, but traditional books don't provide the tools to quickly learn, so we abandon the task.

What if a person could touch on a word in any physical book and learn the definition right away? It wouldn't require asking the friend, or Google, or their professor. It would be faster, tailored to the text, and even tailored to the era. For example, the person could tap the word "software oIigopoIies" and the definition could say "these days, this might be written as 'big tech', like Apple, Meta, Google, and Microsoft." Or perhaps the reader is deeply interested in anticompetitive practices from Microsoft, so a smart and customised definition software could report something like "Microsoft could be described as a "software oIigopoIy" as a way to reach the reader more directly. This is not possible today with physical books, but ebooks and other reader software can.

In the findings, looking up a word on iOS resulted in a LTM sequence of MPTMTT, which is estimated to take 4.7 seconds. In contrast, looking up a word in a physical copy of a book isn't possible, returning an LTM sequence of MHTM[PTK]T, an estimated time of 16.4 seconds, (representing the fastest estimated time someone can quit one app and search for a definition in a dictionary app), and a failing task. This neatly demonstrates the difference between not being able to access answers or context without external help versus having context as part of the reading experience.

Now we'll try a curveball. iOS does a good job defining words when they're in the English language, but fails when it doesn't recognise a word. For example, imagine a reader is enjoying the novel Dune, and they long-press the capitalised word Adept, a term that has special meaning in the Dune literature. iOS will return the English language translation for the word, despite the capitalisation, rather than the actual definition someone is looking for when reading Dune. Worse still is what happens when you try to define a word that doesn't exist at all. If our reader attempts to look up the word Auqaf, they'll be told by iOS that the word isn't available and instead show the definition of the word "Aqua." These failures result in LTM sequences of MPTM[TPTKMPTRT]T, taking 16.95 seconds, conservatively. It could be argued that the additional confusion of expecting a result and getting the wrong one would add more cognitive load and time than simply not having the feature at all.

As a contrast, Amazon's Kindle has a feature called X-Ray that doesn't just perform a simple dictionary search on a word, it attempts to pull other context into the reading experience. Looking up the same Dune words on Kindle result in LTM sequences of MPTT and a time of 2.85 seconds, the fastest of an option by far. When reading, context is king. Any software that can provide useful context is better than software that can't, provided that it only is offered when requested. And amongst different software options that can provide differing levels of quality and speed, the right answers delivered faster will always be better than ones with bad data or that are delivered slowly.

<div id="difficult"></div>
### Creating and socialising new ideas is extremely difficult

In the findings chart, I established a column for "developer effort" with only two options, green arrow up meaning "no big deal" or a red arrow down that means "kind of a big deal." This metric is comically, insultingly vague. The fact that everything from chatGPT's codebase to creating a simple tooltip both fall into the same category shows that this metric is meant for comparative purposes, not any kind of objective measure of difficulty. Put another way, I'm not attempting to say how hard something else, just that it's harder than the traditional way of doing it.

As a tangible example, "comparing two images across two pages" is a common action when seeing two images presented side by side, and requires no special effort from the author or developer. Therefore, it gets a green arrow pointing up. On the other hand, creating a Before and After slider isn't particularly difficult because it's such a common component. But it does take some effort to wire up, so it gets a red arrow pointing down. So these measurements provide a good comparative analysis, whereas a full accounting of exactly how complex each task may be is beyond the scope of this research.

But this metric goes beyond simple coding difficulty. We also need to factor in the complexity of a fragmenting media ecosystem, and the fact that no single entity owns the right to publish ideas on the internet. To illustrate this, let's say you wanted to argue that the Article Diff feature should exist for all media organisations. If you don't work at one, you probably won't get very far. But even if you are the CTO of the New York Times, and you successfully ship the feature to the New York Times audience, you have no control over what the Washington Post does, or the New Zealand Herald. Others may adopt your idea, but it's not really up to you. This means that no matter how good any of the ideas are that I've presented, no matter how much faster or better they are in objective ways, their reach is out of the control of any one entity. And that's a problem for improving the overall experience of reading text.

In doing my literature review, I noticed a lot of research talking about ways to make concepts such as Explorable Explanations more mainstream. A common suggestion was to make new programming languages or paradigms to help more people create helpful content to help people learn more, more effectively. But even with the best new programming language in the world, with the best tutorials, the best outreach content, the most motivated team, and the money to pay for it, it's still much harder to write code than write copy. Some organisations such as Pudding.cool and The New York Times have been able to fund this kind of work, but it's still a minority of all content. It's the opinion of the author that this is appropriate. Most reading should be reading, and even when teaching aids and illustrations are introduced, it should be the bare minimum required to get the main point across, and always something the user requests, rather than something that's pushed on them.

I want to put a very clear line in the sand here: despite all the advantages of augmented text, and in helping people add context to the content they're reading, it's still a tremendous technical challenge that is not easy to address. It won't be addressed or fixed by better programming languages or better ideas. Success of these ideas will emerge slowly and organically, in the marketplace of ideas. If a large organisation such as Wordpress decides to embrace some examples of Augmented Text, then its competitors decide to react in order to stay competitive, the ideas will spread. Slowly, and over time, some ideas might become popular enough in the mainstream. But it will take that, and nothing less than that, not a better programming language. 

<div id="better-metrics"></div>
### We need better metrics to rate ROI
My research struggled to come up with a conceptual framework to help understand which features could benefit from improvements, and by how much. If we could quantify actions easily, like knowing that following any hyperlink took exactly 3 seconds, or researching a footnote always took 7 seconds, I'd have a more objective measure to rely on. Instead, my methodology needed to rely on relative measures. This works well when comparing traditional to traditional approaches, but doesn't work as well when determining the overall benefit of a new feature.

I'd propose a new heuristic for determining the potential success of a new approach: estimate the total number of developer hours a feature might take, and compare it to how many hours we think it will save the audience. For example, if the "Interactive Numbers" feature only requires 8 developer hours to create and implement on a site, whereas one million people would use the feature and each would save 2 minutes, that means the effort took 8 hours but saved 33,333 hours, for an ROI of 4167:1.

On the other hand, imagine if "Summarise Widget (Hard-coded)" takes a team of 12 3 months to implement, but the overall user base it's serving means that only 1000 people will see it and get 5 minutes of value each. That means the team would spend 5,760 hours building a feature that users would get 83 hours of use out of each week, for a ratio of .0145:1. At this rate, it would take 69.12 weeks for the feature to break even. On one hand, that's more than a year for the ROI to pay off. On the other hand, if that year positions your media organisation favourably, and you become known as a site that doesn't just deliver news but helps you comprehend it, maybe that's an investment worth making. But either way, it's important to quantify these ideas in a way that helps determine if they're worth it or not, in as objective a way as possible. Even the best feature in the world, which would help literally everyone who saw it, needs to justify its investment. If only 100 people will see it, but it takes a million dollars to build it, that at least needs to be built into the ROI in some tangible way.

### Augmented text opens new doors
In the digital age, the evolution of text from static to dynamic through augmentation has opened new horizons that were previously unimaginable. Traditional text, while a cornerstone of knowledge transfer and communication for centuries, inherently possesses limitations that restrict the depth of interaction and engagement. This is where the notion that "Some Things Are Simply Not Possible Without Augmented Text" comes into play, underscoring a pivotal shift in how we perceive and interact with written content.

Augmented text transcends these limitations by embedding interactivity, multimedia, and context-aware features directly within the text, enabling a multifaceted reading experience that traditional mediums cannot offer. This enhancement is not merely about adding novelty to reading; it's about fundamentally expanding the capabilities of text to inform, educate, and engage.

One of the most significant advantages of augmented text is its ability to bridge comprehension gaps in real-time. Consider complex scientific papers or historical documents laden with specialised terminology. Without augmentation, readers might find themselves disengaged, lost in jargon that feels inaccessible. Augmented text, however, can instantly provide definitions, explanations, or visual aids at the point of need, seamlessly integrated into the reading experience. This immediacy transforms the act of reading from a passive to an interactive journey, where understanding is not just facilitated but enriched.

The capacity for personalisation is another realm where augmented text shines. Traditional texts offer a one-size-fits-all approach that can't adapt to the diverse needs and preferences of its audience. Augmented text, conversely, can tailor the reading experience to individual users, accommodating different learning styles, languages, and even accessibility needs. This personalisation extends the reach of text, making information not just available but accessible to a broader audience, including those with disabilities who might find traditional text formats challenging.

Augmented text also serves as a platform for creativity and exploration, enabling authors and educators to embed interactive elements, simulations, and exploratory tools within the text. This capability transforms the reading experience into an interactive journey, where readers can simulate experiments, visualise data dynamically, or explore scenarios within the narrative. Such interactivity invites readers to engage deeply with the content, fostering a more profound understanding and retention of information.

Moreover, augmented text overcomes the physical and digital boundaries that confine traditional text. Geographic and temporal constraints, which once limited the dissemination and relevance of information, are rendered moot. Augmented text can incorporate real-time data, connect readers across the globe through collaborative annotations, or update content to reflect the latest developments, ensuring the information remains relevant and timely.

Despite its potential, the widespread adoption of augmented text faces significant challenges, particularly in implementation. Developing sophisticated augmented text systems requires considerable investment in technology, design, and content creation. Moreover, the technological infrastructure to support such features must be universally accessible, posing a challenge in ensuring equitable access to the benefits of augmented text.

Looking ahead, the possibilities of augmented text are vast and largely untapped. As technology advances, we can anticipate even more innovative forms of augmentation, from augmented reality overlays that bring text to life in our physical environment to AI-driven personal assistants that provide contextual insights and support. These advancements promise to further dissolve the barriers between readers and the knowledge they seek, ushering in a new era of text that is not just read but experienced.

### The limitations of explorable explanations
I'm just as optimistic about Bret Victor's work now as before I started my research. The idea that words are of limited value when exploring complex concepts is self evident. The advantages of a play-oriented mindset when attempting to learn a new thing is as foundational an insight as a rule of thermodynamics. Breakthrough essays like Snowfall and the resulting backlash to them stressed an idea we could feel in our bones at the time, and scientific data is merely serving to quantify a thing we know in our bones: it's not just about the information, but now well the information is presented and taught. 

It's why great teachers are so valuable, and the same applies to great books, great documentaries, great translations. To communicate clearly and effectively is next to godliness. And if it were easy, everyone would do it.  Sadly, it's not easy. And that's where the limitations of Victor and Case's work becomes evident. The techniques they propose are good in theory, but sometimes prohibitively difficult to produce. This matters, and it's what my research made clear as I compared different techniques. No matter how valuable the feature, if it too complex to make or to experience, it wouldn't matter. This is what Fogh discovered in their work, and I was able to replicate. Good ideas are good, but they need to justify the effort it takes to build and experience them.

I'm left as optimistic as ever about the idea of helping people understand complex concepts with more advanced uses of multimedia. But the future won't be full of explorable explanations, any more than the world is full of educational software. However, subtle yet powerful ways of improving core reading experience will only grow in popularity and usage. It won't be a broad, mainstream revolution where everything changes overnight. Instead, it will be the small and consistent improvements to core reading experiences over many years that will move us forward. 

<div id="possibilities"></div>

### The possibilities are vast and contextual
The exploration of augmented text thus far has only scratched the surface of its potential. By examining a select few examples, we've begun to understand its impact. However, the true breadth of possibilities it holds is as boundless as the diversity of content that exists in our world. Augmented text is not merely a tool for enhancing traditional reading experiences; it's a gateway to uncharted territories of knowledge and interaction.

Consider the realm of memes, a ubiquitous form of digital communication that blends humour, culture, and commentary. Augmented text could offer tools to dissect and understand the layers of meaning within a meme, contextualising its references and nuances for those not in the know. Such tools could transform fleeting moments of entertainment into rich, educational experiences, broadening our understanding of digital culture.

The potential applications extend far beyond popular culture, reaching into the specialised and complex worlds of various professions. For lawyers, augmented text could revolutionise the way legal documents are interacted with, offering real-time annotations, precedent references, and legal interpretations at the touch of a word. This could demystify legal language, making it more accessible to practitioners and the public alike.

In the medical field, doctors and students could benefit from augmented textbooks and journals that offer interactive diagrams, patient case studies, and the latest research findings embedded directly within the text. This could facilitate a deeper understanding of medical conditions and treatments, enhancing the learning process and ultimately improving patient care.

The possibilities are indeed vast and contextual, limited only by our imagination and the technological advancements that continue to unfold. As augmented text evolves, it promises to reshape not only how we consume information but also how we interact with the world around us. It encourages a future where knowledge is more accessible, education is more interactive, and our capacity for understanding and innovation is boundless.

This vision of the future, powered by augmented text, is not just an aspiration but a call to action for creators, developers, and thinkers. It challenges us to envision and build new ways of sharing and discovering knowledge, to transcend the limitations of traditional text, and to embrace the vast, untapped potential that lies within augmented text.

As we stand on the precipice of this new era, it's clear that the journey ahead is filled with exciting possibilities. The exploration of augmented text is a path to unlocking new dimensions of understanding and engagement, promising to enrich our lives in ways we're only beginning to imagine.

## Conclusion

<div id="further"></div>
#### Further Research

The exploration of augmented text opens avenues for enhancing accessibility, offering a transformative potential for inclusivity. Future research must delve into the integration of assistive technologies, ensuring that augmented text becomes a tool for all, breaking barriers for those with disabilities. Establishing more objective measures for evaluating augmented text's efficacy stands paramount. This involves developing metrics that go beyond subjective analysis, allowing for a quantifiable assessment of the impact on user comprehension and engagement.

Expanding the repository of augmented text features tailored for specialised fields like healthcare, education, law, and IT could revolutionise professional and academic landscapes. Such research would explore domain-specific enhancements that cater to the unique needs of each field, potentially altering how professionals engage with text-based information.

In healthcare, for instance, augmented text could enable interactive medical journals that respond to touch, providing instant visualizations of complex anatomical structures. Education could benefit from augmented textbooks that adapt to the learner's pace and style, offering personalised explanations. The legal field might see contracts that elucidate terms with a simple tap, while IT could use augmented manuals that visually guide users through troubleshooting steps.

These explorations require interdisciplinary collaboration, pooling expertise from technologists, domain specialists, and educators. The goal is to create a symbiosis between text and technology that enriches, rather than dilutes, the essence of reading. Ethical considerations will be paramount, ensuring that these innovations serve to empower rather than disenfranchise.

As we embrace the digital age's challenges and opportunities, research in augmented text becomes not just an academic pursuit but a societal imperative. It's a journey towards a more enlightened, accessible, and connected world through the power of text, transformed.

## Appendix 1: This research in a narrative format

I first wrote this thesis in the style of something I'd expect to read in The New Yorker or The Atlantic. This style is more narrative, relies less on research and methodology, and lands somewhere between a call to action and a history lesson around a campfire. I'm including it in the appendix because there are wonderful stories to be hold that the research paper style doesn't do as good a job at showing.

<DancingAboutArchitecture />

Let's ponder this for a moment—the little 'Explain Like I'm Five' feature you just witnessed is a little parlour trick that traditional books can't replicate. The closest you come come in a conventional book might be a "turn to page 83 to see this described so a 5 year old could understand it," feature. A user might awkwardly flip back and forth between an advanced explanation and a simplified one, but it's clunky and doesn't flow in the same way.

And what if we want to adapt the text even further? Imagine trying to accommodate someone with dyslexia by altering the font, shielding a reader from content they might find distressing, or providing detailed teaching materials for teaching complex concepts like Shakespeare. These concepts far exceed the technological abilities of standard books, so most don't even try. And those who do feel awkward and unwieldy, with supporting content and insights relegated to footnotes, never a cohesive part of the core reading experience.

If we agree that the act of reading can be improved with increased context, we might swing to the other end of the spectrum and make everything into standalone apps or websites. While those solutions may provide more context and assistance, they would be frustrating. No one wants to download a new app for every book they read. Even if these apps came packed with every conceivable feature, the sheer bulk of information in the reading experience would make them unwieldy as well, adding intolerable cognitive weight to what should be a simple act of reading.

  

At its heart, augmented text is about preserving the simplicity and joy of reading while carefully and discreetly weaving in layers of interactivity. These digital features are nimble, unobtrusive, and responsive to our individual needs, whether it's toggling between an advanced and simplified explanation with a simple click or changing the visual presentation for accessibility. They're there when you need them, invisible when you don't, enhancing our understanding without overshadowing the text itself. Thus the principles of **seamless blending** and **concise enhancement**.

  

Think of augmented text as a book that responds to each user's individual needs. It's the bridge between the static page and the dynamic world of digital possibilities. A canvas where text is no longer just ink on paper but a helpful entity that adapts to the unique needs of its reader. It's an environment where the barriers to understanding are lowered, not by replacing the book, but by enhancing it in ways that were once the exclusive domain of science fiction.

  

And that's what this paper will explore—how augmented text takes the timeless act of reading and imbues it with the adaptability of the digital age. Just as a chameleon changes its colours to suit its environment, augmented text reshapes itself to suit the reader's needs. It's reading, reimagined for a world where the written word is no longer static, but dynamic; not fixed, but fluid; not one-size-fits-all, but personalised. It's a quiet revolution, a gentle augmentation of the reading experience that promises to make it richer, more accessible, and infinitely more adaptable. It's an step forward that is long overdue.

### In the beginning, there were words

The essence of storytelling has never changed. From ancient tales shared around the fire to today's digital narratives, the objective has always been to inform, entertain, persuade, and connect on as wide a scale as possible. Just as ancient storytellers might have held their listeners spellbound with memorable narratives around a campfire, so do modern podcasts, TED Talks, and Netflix shows. Cuneiform, the printing press, and the internet are extraordinarily different technologies and implementations yet are aiming towards the same noble goal: reaching as many people as possible to communicate as effectively as possible.

There are parallels between old and new, because storytelling is core to the human experience. While tools and technologies evolve, the fundamental human need for communication remains. Augmented text, with its interactive and multimedia capabilities, is simply the latest iteration in this continuum. It takes the essence of what has always been important in communication — clarity, impact, engagement, and accessibility — and builds upon it with the benefits afforded by modern technology that we're missing out on by not re-evaluating the experience of reading and improving it to keep pace with how people read in modern contexts.

By weaving this story arc through this research, we'll show that augmented text is not an faddish outlier in the history of communication but the next step of a natural progression. It embodies the same principles that have driven the development of communication methods for millennia, now accelerated by digital interactivity and the global reach of the internet. This perspective will serve to situate augmented text within a broader historical context, demonstrating its relevance and potential as the next step in the ongoing journey of human expression. We'll also illustrate why a next step is necessary, and why multimedia has plateaued since the invention of the hyperlink.

### Let's get specific

When our ancient ancestors narrated stories around the fire, they were not only preserving their heritage but also embedding the roots of language as we understand it today. This fundamental drive for communication echoes Noam Chomsky's influential linguistic theories. Chomsky (1957) introduced the groundbreaking concept of a "universal grammar," proposing that certain aspects of linguistic structure are innate to the human mind and thus universally present in all languages. This perspective, which he further developed in his later works (Chomsky, 1965), implies that the capacity for language is biologically hardwired rather than acquired. Chomsky's theories, as expounded in his subsequent works (Chomsky, 2005), suggest that this innate language facility has played a critical role in human evolution, shaping our ability to communicate complex ideas and narratives. The transition from oral tradition to written language, a pivotal moment in the history of human communication, can be viewed through the lens of Chomsky's linguistic framework. Lewandowska-Tomaszczyk (2016) further expounded on the evolution and impact of Chomsky's generative grammar, underscoring its significance in the progression from oral storytelling to the written word. These theoretical insights provide a deeper understanding of the intrinsic nature of language and its role in human civilisation.

Around 3400 BC, Sumerian scribes in Mesopotamia laid the groundwork for the first known form of written communication, called cuneiform. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform) This intricate system of wedge-shaped marks pressed into clay tablets allowed the recording of inventories, laws, and narratives, marking a significant improvement around how humankind preserved and disseminated knowledge. This allowed information to outlive its author and be shared with audiences for the first time. The impact of this technology cannot be overstated; it's easily on par with the invention of the wheel and fire, and was the precursor, however humbly, to the contemporary reading experience we experience today.

Tablets were a good start, but they were hardly portable. This lead to the invention of paper by the Chinese around the 1st century AD. Then the printing press, invented by Johannes Gutenberg in 15th century Europe, took the revolution a step further by making the process easier and widely available. Knowledge was no longer the exclusive domain of the affluent and the clergy; it was accessible to anyone who could read. (Kross et al., 2021) Like cuneiform and paper before it, this technology permanently changed the way humanity communicated, and the resulting impact, again, cannot be overstated. As Albertin et al. (2018) explore, the forces unleashed when information became more portable weren't all good or all bad. They simply accelerated many good and bad aspects of society, an insight that seems familiar to us today with all the promise and peril of the modern internet.

The evolution from spoken word to written, then from expensive to cheap, set up the desktop and internet revolutions of the late 20th century, followed by the explosion of smartphone usage, which made communication as cheap and plentiful as it’s ever been. Today, the combination of the internet and mobile means we've never had more content, in reach of as many people (both in absolute terms and per capita), being produced by more people. Yet the technology we're using to communicate multimedia concepts has stayed surprisingly static for the last 50 years. With the exception of the popularisation of the hyperlink in the 1990s, there has been very little technological innovation that has changed the way we consume the written word.

We used to speak around campfires, whereas now we record podcasts, shoot Instagram stories, and record video chats. But at their heart, it's all just verbal communication. We used to write stories, first on caves, then on tablets, then on paper. Now we've added websites, status updates, ebooks, and group texts, but and their heart, they're all just textual communication. You can tell the same stories about music and video; music has always been music, even as the technology powering them changes and evolves. Movies have always been movies, whether black and white, full colour, 3d, or VR. And the consumption experiences for all have stayed largely the same as well. We still watch movies and plays in theatres, we still listen to music on our own or as part of a group concert. We still watch people tell stories, whether around a campfire, on YouTube, or at a stand-up comedy show. The more things change, the more they stay the same.

"By perceiving modern digital formats like the Kindle, YouTube videos, or online news stories as mere digital versions of their traditional counterparts, we risk missing opportunities for more impactful communication. This oversight is akin to the initial limitations of early websites and TV shows, which merely replicated existing physical and broadcast formats. Neil Postman, in his seminal work 'Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business,' echoes this concern, critiquing the tendency to view new media forms as mere extensions of the old without acknowledging their unique characteristics and implications (Citation: Postman, 1985). He warns against the uncritical acceptance of these forms, urging a more nuanced examination of how they shape communication and discourse. This phenomenon highlights the importance of seamlessly blending new technologies with traditional media. Just as television evolved from the simplicity of 'I Love Lucy' to the complexity of 'Game of Thrones,' our understanding and use of digital media must also progress. While the essence of storytelling remains constant, the methods of delivery should be enhanced, aiming for both conciseness and seamless integration with emerging technologies."

The realm of interactive media and multimedia, while often static in its approach, contrasts sharply with the dynamic nature of games, which have consistently been a fertile ground for interactive innovations. This distinction is particularly evident in the work of Barr, who explores the unique aspects of human-computer interaction within video games. In his research, Barr (Citation: 2008) emphasises that unlike traditional software, video games are played rather than used, necessitating a different approach to understanding interaction—one that considers 'play' as a central component. His analysis of how players' beliefs and values about preferable conduct influence their interaction with games sheds light on the multi-layered complexity of gaming as a form of human-computer interaction. This perspective is crucial for comprehending the interactive depth of games and their potential for innovation in the broader multimedia landscape, and why it far exceeds the narrow scope of what a reading experience demands.

This raises some crucial questions: Can elements from gaming be integrated seamlessly with traditional communication forms in a way that enhances rather than complicates the simple act of reading and the plain goal of communicating clearly? Does "play" automatically cause text to move from the realm of reading and into something more cognitively heavy, and therefore less effective as text? The answers are nuanced, and this exploration will delve into how interactive elements can be incorporated concisely and seamlessly into augmented text. Our aim is to explore how these interactive components can enrich the storytelling experience without overwhelming the core message, and therefore adhering to the principles of augmented text.

### A Failure of Imagination

To understand how contemporary multimedia is created, imagine writing a blog post in a large media organisation. What forms of media would be in your multimedia toolkit?

- Text input
- Links
- Images
- Video

And that's it. If you want to add something as simple as a gallery or slideshow of photos, you require a special widget or component. In most cases, this request would require special knowledge from someone with the right experience to offer it. This is reminiscent of how early versions of the bible were only decipherable by highly educated people in the church, requiring average people to ask for help. (Citation: Bible Gateway, n.d.) What if you want to show a comparison between two images, perhaps to show a before and after image of the effects of hurricane? Again, you'd be out of luck without someone coding the component for you. Or what if you wanted to provide some light interactivity to help explain a complex concept? Not possible unless you can explain it in text, images, or maybe a video. It's hard to argue that "text, sometimes with an image embedded in it," really counts as interactive multimedia. It's pretty close to reading a magazine or newspaper from 100 years ago, the only difference being that it's delivered over the internet, to a screen, with hyperlinks, and sometimes with an embedded video.

On the other end of the interactive spectrum, we have video games, a media type categorisation so broad as to be meaningless. One could make the argument that the subject matter addressed by games is even more vast than the entire collected works of books in all of human recorded history. The difference is in interactivity. Romeo and Juliet is just another love story, but if you played Romeo and Juliet as a simulated experience, you could drive the story however you want. By definition, a book will have one ending. By definition, many games will be expected to have multiple endings, multiple paths to get there, and a sense of autonomy that makes each experience necessarily different from anyone else's experience. Citizen Kane is an epic movie about a legendary character. A single interactive product like World of Warcraft aims to provide multiple storylines just as epic and personalised as Citizen Kane to the more than 100 million people who have played it. In terms of sheer quantity, there's no contest which experience provides a wider range of experiences.

But quantity isn't the only metric. When you're reading a news article, you're not seeking a game of pinball. When you're playing Minecraft, you're not seeking to read a 300 page book of lore. As demonstrated in Grain of the Web (Citation: Chimero, 2015) and referred to frequently in this thesis, effective communication with text and media requires using the right tool for the job. Just as you wouldn't use a screwdriver to hammer a nail, or rely on interpretative dance to critique some architecture, an essay doesn't work as well as a series of images. A comic wouldn’t work as well described orally. A painting wasn’t meant to be a video. There is a “grain” to each media type that guides authors towards how to best use them, and if you go against the grain, they are less effective. The key to successful design and communication is to work within the space. I propose that multimedia artists have gotten complacent, where we have simple CMS systems for writing with text + images and overly complex game authoring environments for anything more complex than text. There's a vast space in between those extremes that warrants a closer look. To date, the closest word most people have used to describe this space is "simulation."

Simulations live between full-fledged games and traditional written content. They provide a bridge between the static and the interactive, allowing users to manipulate variables and observe the outcomes. This makes simulations particularly effective for demonstrating complex systems or processes that would be difficult to explain with text or images alone. For example, in the context of climate science, a simulation could allow users to increase or decrease greenhouse gas emissions and observe the effects on global temperature, sea level, and more. The interactivity of simulations supports active learning, as users can explore the system or process at their own pace, experimenting with different scenarios and seeing the results. This helps users to understand not just what happens, but why it happens, deepening their understanding and knowledge retention. This is not a new field, but it's one that's been poorly defined and advocated for for many years. The closest we've come in the popular imagination is when Bret Victor identified this spectrum of communication and coined the term “Explorable Explanations” to describe products that live in the middle of the two extremes: written content that uses interactive components to communicate concepts more effectively. (Citation: Victor, 2011) That's where we'll be focusing next.
### “Explorable Explanations” and “Active Essays”

Bret Victor introduced the concept of Explorable Explanations to offer a new way of presenting and interacting with text. The core idea is to transform text from mere information to be consumed into an "environment to think in." This was envisioned as an umbrella project with the goal of encouraging truly active reading. To make abstract concepts more concrete, Victor proposed the development of reactive documents that allow readers to manipulate authors' assumptions and see the consequences, explorable examples that make abstract concepts concrete, and contextual information that allows readers to learn related material just-in-time and cross-check the author's claims.

Victor's ideas, however, were not completely new. Computing pioneer Alan Kay had previously discussed the concept of active essays which blended computer-based simulations with explanatory text. (Citation: Kay, 2003) This was a part of his vision for transforming the computer into a new kind of medium for creative thought, combining the dynamic and interactive nature of the computer with the narrative and argumentative strength of the essay.

These ideas have led to a surge of explorations in the field. Notably, Nicky Case has been instrumental in bringing these ideas to life. One notable example is "Parable of the Polygons", a web-based interactive simulation game that visually demonstrates how small individual biases can lead to large collective biases, thus providing an explorable explanation of systemic societal biases. (Citation: Hart and Case, 2014)

By 2012, Explorable explanations were gaining momentum, as authors in education, journalism, and data science began to see the potential these interactive tools had for transforming their fields. Educators were recognising the value of engaging students in a more active role, where critical thinking was not just encouraged but required. Journalists, on platforms such as Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight, were starting to experiment with these tools, using them to elucidate complex datasets and statistical models, allowing their readers to interact with and digest intricate information through hands-on exploration.

Yet, despite these burgeoning explorations, there was a lingering challenge in defining what exactly constituted an explorable explanation. Was it distinct from a simulation, a game, or an interactive educational tool? The boundaries remained blurred. It was difficult to pinpoint a single instance that encapsulated the entire concept until "Snowfall" arrived and set a new benchmark. It was a traditional article, not an embedded video or interactive demo, but the careful and innovative touches of interactivity they added hit the collective imagination as something new and useful. And not just that, it won a Pulitzer.
### The Importance of Snowfall

When The New York Times released the "Snow Fall" interactive feature (Citation: Duenes & Kueneman, 2012), it sparked waves of excitement within the digital media industry. This unprecedented piece of multimedia storytelling, a long-form article punctuated by interactive graphics, videos, and immersive animations, seemed to herald the dawn of a new era for online media. Snowfall was a trailblazer, representing a powerful blend of traditional journalistic storytelling and interactive elements, promising an engaging and immersive reader experience.

The innovative approach of Snowfall was met with critical acclaim, winning the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing. Its influence was quickly seen in the proliferation of 'Snowfall-like' features across the digital media landscape, as news outlets and other media organisations sought to emulate its success. The term 'Snowfall' even became a verb within the industry, describing the process of creating rich, multimedia experiences within a long-form article.

However, the initial enthusiasm surrounding Snowfall was soon tempered. Despite the benefits of the new format, it was still hard to use, buggy, and complicated. The production of Snowfall was a costly endeavour, both in terms of time and resources. It required a team of skilled developers and designers working intensively over several months to bring the project to fruition. This high level of investment was not a feasible model for most media outlets, particularly for those with smaller budgets or shorter timelines.

Furthermore, the feature was not without technical issues. Users reported numerous bugs, with interactive elements often failing to load properly or behaving inconsistently across different devices and browsers. The high-quality multimedia content, while visually impressive, was also demanding on system resources, leading to slow load times and performance issues for users with less powerful computers or slower internet connections.

The conundrum posed by "Snowfall" is far from unique in the history of technological innovation. History is full of pioneering ideas that have stumbled at the crossroads of potential and practicality. Take, for example, the early days of virtual reality in the 1990s. As Durlach and Mavor noted in their 1995 work, these early VR systems often characterised by inelegant hardware, a nausea-inducing user experience, and prohibitive costs, making the technology not yet ripe for widespread adoption.

Similarly, consider the early generations of mass-produced electric cars, which emerged as a beacon of promise for a cleaner, more efficient future in personal transport. Initiated by major auto manufacturers in response to the evolving landscape of the 1970s and 1990s, these vehicles, including notable models like General Motors' EV1, embodied the potential for a significant shift in automotive technology. However, they were beset by substantial drawbacks. The quality of these early electric cars was often compromised by issues such as limited range, lengthy charging times, and a lack of necessary infrastructure. Furthermore, as Gandoman et al. (Citation: 2019) highlight, the reliability and safety of these early electric vehicles' components, including battery packs, power electronic converters, and electric motors, were significant concerns. Despite carrying the seeds of a greener future, these vehicles were emblematic of the challenges that pioneering technologies often face - showing a path forward, but not yet ready to meet the practical demands of the time (Citation: Team GridREV, 2011; Gandoman et al., 2019).

Both these examples underscore the fits and starts that any technology must suffer through before finding broad commercial success, if at all. Writer William Gibson has observed "the future is already here — it's just not very evenly distributed." Is this so? An average consumer, even a rich one, couldn't experience any kind of device we'd recognise as a smartphone in 1983, and the best technology in the world today can't reliably make nuclear fusion work. "But there were indeed prototype versions of smartphones as early as 1983 (Citation: History of mobile phones, n.d.) and prototypes of fusion power achieving significant breakthroughs in 2023 (Citation: Tollefson, 2023)." The question is not whether or not the future "exists" (a low bar if speculative fiction and forgotten research papers counts as "existing") but instead if the technology is good enough for mainstream commercialised appeal. The length of time between a product's invention to commercialisation, then from market formation, expansion, and eventually saturation, can stretch for a long time. For example, chatGPT only took two months to reach 100,000,000 users, but the concept of AI was first coined in 1956. OpenAI was founded in December 2015, GPT was built in 2018, GPT-3 arrived in 2020, and the chatGPT that became the fastest growing consumer product in human history wasn't released until November 2022. (Citation: UBS, 2023) Every step relied on the steps that came before it, but the impact to the rest of the world didn't come when the technology theoretically existed, but when normal people could benefit from it.

"Snowfall" was right on the cusp between being good enough to inspire and broken enough to frustrate. Its vision for a new storytelling paradigm was clear, but the tools and systems necessary for its realisation were not yet in place for broad acceptance. The challenge, then, as with all emerging technologies, was to close the gap between the vanguard of innovation and the trailing edge of accessibility. It was about finding scalable, efficient, and economically viable ways to deliver the rich potential of interactive media to all users, regardless of their technological or financial circumstances. The road from potential to ubiquity is rarely a straight line; it is a winding path marked by iteration, refinement, and the gradual democratisation of once-exclusive and experimental technologies.

### The Snowfall backlash (The Web's Grain)

In 2015, three years post "Snowfall," Frank Chimero published "The Web's Grain," an insightful reflection on web design and digital interaction. (Citation: Chimero, 2015) Without directly mentioning "Snowfall," Chimero struck a chord with developers wrestling with similar issues. His concept of "grain" in media products, borrowed from the craft of woodworking, articulated a truth many sensed but hadn't named—it's the intrinsic nature of materials that should guide our creations.

Chimero's "grain" speaks to the inherent properties of any medium. Just as wood has a direction to its fibers that informs a carpenter's work, digital mediums have an inherent "grain" that should guide design. The most harmonious digital experiences, Chimero suggests, are those crafted in sync with the web’s flexible, interconnected nature, respecting its "edgelessness" or the absence of strict confines.

Snowfall, while innovative, arguably bucked against the web's grain. Its ambition outstripped its execution, becoming a resource-heavy behemoth that often stumbled across the varied landscape of devices and browsers. It lacked the fluidity and adaptability that Chimero identified as hallmarks of the web's true nature. This pioneering project was indeed a spectacle, but one that perhaps flew too close to the sun, revealing the delicate balance between innovation and the current technological reach. It underscored the necessity for digital creations to not only push boundaries but also to move in harmony with the ever-evolving digital ecosystem.

Chimero might argue that this approach ran counter to the web's inherent fluidity and adaptability. While the project harnessed some of the web's potential for rich multimedia storytelling, its complex design and performance issues revealed a misalignment with the web's grain.

Yet, despite these flaws, the concept behind Snowfall aligns with Chimero's vision of embracing the web's unique capacities. The New York Times's interactive feature represents an attempt to leverage the web's potential for creating immersive, interconnected experiences that transcend traditional linear storytelling. Even though its execution was not perfect, the ambition and innovation behind Snowfall signalled a step towards more engaging and interactive forms of online content.

Chimero’s essay urges us to step back from the precipice of overcomplicated, overly-ambitious design and to reconsider the fundamental properties of the web – a more versatile, flexible and inherently complex medium than any that have come before. This call for a return to simplicity, however, is not a call for stagnation or resistance against innovation. Rather, it is a challenge to embrace the medium in its fullness, harness its unique properties, and wield these attributes to push the boundaries of digital storytelling.

Seen through this lens, "Snowfall" isn’t so much a failed experiment, but an important milestone that stretched the conceptual limits of online communication. It unveiled a tantalising glimpse of the web’s potential while laying bare the challenges of aligning with the web’s unique grain. This experience showed us the value in creating digital narratives that are innovative, accessible, and engaging – narratives that ride with the web's grain rather than against it.

The promise of Snowfall, then, isn't in the specific form it took but rather the vision it represented – a vision of using the web's unique capacities for storytelling, learning, and understanding. It's about blending the strengths of the medium with content, not wedging content into unwieldy software experiences.

However, to translate this vision into practice, we need to focus on what makes online documents successful: text, video, images, and embedded widgets. These components are not just passive containers of information, but dynamic instruments of communication, each with its unique way of engaging users and conveying meaning.

In addition to these, we introduce the concept of responsive communication - an innovative approach that focuses on enhancing comprehension and interactivity. To truly harness the web's grain, we must design digital experiences that respond to users' actions and adapt to their needs. These can range from interactive diagrams that users can manipulate to gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter, to smart annotations that provide additional information on demand, to simulations that allow users to explore different scenarios and outcomes.

These components create a more holistic and immersive experience. They do not function as separate, disconnected pieces wedged into a page but as a cohesive whole. They become a part of the narrative, supplementing and enhancing the main text rather than distracting from it.

But, as we move towards embracing these new tools and approaches, we must not lose sight of the core of all communication: words. The fundamental purpose of any digital communication, no matter how visually stunning or interactively engaging, is to convey meaning through content.

Therefore, we propose creating a component library - a collection of versatile, reusable components that seamlessly integrate into the narrative flow, enhancing the storytelling and learning process. A tool like this allows us to avoid the pitfall of over-complication, keeping us grounded in our ultimate goal: to communicate effectively.

In essence, our journey from Snowfall, through The Web's Grain, and back to words represents a shift in our understanding and approach to digital storytelling. It's about recognising the unique grain of the web and using it to create more meaningful, effective, and engaging experiences. It's about finding that sweet spot between innovation and accessibility, where the technology enhances the narrative rather than overwhelming it.
### We Can Do Better

Innovation within and beyond the grain is an exciting frontier in the exploration of text as a medium. Whether adhering to the grain or boldly defying it, creators have the opportunity to craft meaningful, engaging, and transformative experiences. From the artistic experimentation of "House of Leaves" to the multi-modal storytelling of "Homestuck," the adaptive evolution of music, the intricate puzzles of web ARGs, and the ongoing exploration of digital text, the journey is filled with potential.

It's about striking a balance between tradition and innovation, resonance and dissonance, familiarity and novelty. It's about recognising the grain, understanding its limitations, and pushing its boundaries. It's about building not just the song but also the concert hall, not just the words but also the world in which they live.

The challenge and opportunity lie in our willingness to explore, to question, to experiment, and to innovate. The grain of the medium is not a constraint but a starting point, a foundation upon which we can build, expand, and reimagine. The future of text is a canvas waiting to be painted, a story waiting to be told, a grain waiting to be explored. Whether it's a multi-layered digital comic, a groundbreaking television show, or a novel that defies conventional reading, the potential is vast, and the grain is ripe for exploration. So let's explore!

<div id="inspiration"></div>
## Appendix 2: Inspiration Gallery
While working on this paper, I spent a lot of time discovering work by people who understood that text could be more than text with embedded media and hyperlinks. I couldn't bear to leave them out of my research, so I've included them here for inspiration.

### Artists working with the "grain" of text

The concept of working with the grain of a medium has been a guiding principle in various artistic and communicative endeavours. It reflects an alignment with the innate tendencies and capacities of a given medium, allowing creators to craft resonant and effective experiences. However, innovation and exploration often require stepping beyond established boundaries, breaking traditional moulds, and forging new paths. This adventurous spirit of exploration can lead to groundbreaking works that redefine our understanding of the medium itself.

**Breaking the Mould: "House of Leaves"**

An exemplary case of breaking outside the bounds of traditional artistic forms is Mark Z. Danielewski's novel "House of Leaves." Unlike the vast majority of books that can be easily transformed into ePubs or other digital formats, "House of Leaves" defies simple categorisation. It plays with visual design, page numbers, colours, and special codes, making it closer to an artistic artefact than a simple book. As Danielewski says:

> *Books don't have to be so limited. They can intensify informational content and experience. Multiple stories can lie side by side on the page.. Words can also be colored and those colors can have meaning. How quickly pages are turned or not turned can be addressed. Hell pages can be tilted, turned upside down, even read backwards... But here's the joke. Books have had this capacity all along... Books are remarkable constructions with enormous possibilities... But somehow the analogue powers of these wonderful bundles of paper have been for- gotten. Somewhere along the way, all its possibilities were denied. I'd like to see that perception change. I'd like to see the book reintroduced for all it really is.*

(Hansen, 2004)

The novel's complex layout and multifaceted narrative structure are integral to the reading experience, and they cannot be replicated in standard digital formats. Footnotes lead to appendices, mirrored text demands physical interaction, and different fonts and colours signify various layers of the story. This design goes against the grain of traditional book publishing, turning the physical book into a part of the narrative itself.

This deliberate choice to defy the conventional grain of book design has led to a unique and immersive reading experience, one that challenges readers' expectations and engages them on a deeper level. "House of Leaves" is not just a novel; it is a literary labyrinth that invites exploration, reflection, and active participation.

**Adapting to the Environment: "How Music Works"**

In his 2012 book "How Music Works," David Byrne explores how different kinds of music are impacted by the environment. He illustrates how musical compositions have evolved to reflect the characteristics of the spaces in which they are performed. From grand concert halls to intimate chambers, from boomboxes to headphones, music has adapted to resonate with the grain of the listening experience. 

Byrne's insights reveal how understanding and aligning with the grain of the environment can lead to powerful and harmonious musical expressions. The art is not only in crafting the song but also in understanding the "concert hall" it will be played in.

**Nicky Case:**

Nicky Case’s work epitomizes the power of interactive storytelling. Through projects like "Loopy", Case has demonstrated how complex systems and ideas can be conveyed through playful, interactive models. Loopy, for instance, allows users to create and play with dynamic systems, making the abstract concepts of feedback loops and systemic behaviours accessible and understandable. Nicky Case’s creations are not just about passive consumption of information, but about fostering a deeper understanding through interaction and exploration. This approach breaks down the barriers of complexity, making learning a fun and engaging endeavour. (Case, n.d.)

**Integration of Nicky Case's Work into Augmented Text**

Nicky Case's explorables, like "Parable of the Polygons" and "Loopy," embody the essence of augmented text by transforming static narratives into interactive experiences. These explorables are not merely embedded media; they are synergistic with the text, enhancing and expanding upon the written word without overshadowing it. This integration aligns perfectly with the goal of augmented text, which seeks to create a seamless blend of textual and interactive elements. By incorporating these explorables into the narrative, they serve as a bridge between traditional text and modern multimedia, creating a richer, more engaging reader experience.

Case’s work is exemplary in demonstrating the power of interactive storytelling. "Parable of the Polygons" is particularly relevant, using simple shapes and movements to illuminate complex social issues such as segregation and diversity. This interactive model allows users to engage with the content at a deeper level, manipulating variables and witnessing the immediate consequences of their actions. It's a poignant example of how augmented text can elevate understanding through participation.

Similarly, "Loopy" invites users to create and manipulate systems, learning through doing. It's a tool that encourages exploration and experimentation, key aspects of learning that are often undervalued in traditional text. By pulling these examples into the pattern library, your thesis not only acknowledges their value but also provides a framework for others to build upon.

As augmented text seeks to make information more accessible and engaging, Case's explorables serve as a beacon, showing how complex concepts can be distilled into interactive, understandable formats. The challenge lies in analysing these works to extract underlying principles that can be applied broadly to augmented text. It's about finding the balance between the illustrative power of interactivity and the clarity and brevity of the text. Case’s explorables do not replace the text; they enhance it, providing a model for augmented text that is both informative and captivating.

By incorporating these explorables into your thesis, you are not only acknowledging the work of a pioneer in interactive storytelling but also laying the groundwork for future explorations into augmented text. It's a testament to the power of interactivity as a complement to traditional writing, and a step towards a more dynamic, engaging form of communication.

Nicky Case's work is indispensable for the exploration of augmented text. These interactive narratives are more than mere examples; they are the embodiment of the potential that augmented text holds. They show how text can evolve beyond the page, becoming a dynamic tool for education, understanding, and engagement. By integrating these works into your thesis, you highlight the future possibilities of text and set a standard for others to follow.

**Google's interactive explorables**

The exploration of Google's interactive explorables presents an opportunity to observe how a tech giant interprets and applies the concept of augmented text. Their explorables page is a showcase of how interactive elements can be seamlessly integrated with textual information to enhance the user's understanding and engagement. This section will delve into specific examples from Google's repository (Google, n.d.) that embody the principles of augmented text and how they can be applied to educational and informational content.

Google's approach to machine learning visualization is particularly noteworthy. By allowing users to adjust data points and instantly see the algorithm’s response, these explorables simplify the complexities of AI, making them approachable for non-experts. The immediate feedback provided by these tools exemplifies how augmented text can transform the reader's role from passive recipient to active participant.

Another feature worth highlighting is the "scroll through time" function, which offers a dynamic means to visualize change and development. This interactive timeline could serve as a model for illustrating the evolution of communication technologies in your thesis, offering readers a vivid understanding of historical transformations.

These examples of Google's explorables could serve as prototypes for augmented text within the thesis, illustrating the potential of interactive elements to enrich educational narratives. By discussing these tools, the thesis can demonstrate the practical applications of augmented text in simplifying and elucidating complex concepts. This analysis will also provide insights into the design principles that make these explorables effective, such as their intuitive interfaces and the balance between interactivity and informational content.

Through the inclusion of Google's explorables, your thesis can present a compelling argument for the integration of interactive media into traditional text, suggesting a future where digital communication is not only informative but also engaging and interactive. The section will conclude with a critical reflection on how these examples can inform the development of a pattern library for augmented text, which other researchers and practitioners can reference and expand upon.

**Incorporating Bartosz Ciechanowski's Work into Augmented Text**

Bartosz Ciechanowski's site provides an impressive list of interactive articles (Ciechanowski, n.d.) that exemplify the principles of augmented text. His approach to explaining complex topics through interactive graphics and intuitive explanations sets a benchmark for what augmented text can achieve. This section will explore how his work can be dissected to inform and inspire the pattern library of augmented text within the thesis.

Ciechanowski's articles, such as those elucidating the mechanics of cameras or the intricacies of internal combustion engines, go beyond mere illustration; they invite readers to interact with the concepts being discussed. This interactivity transforms the reader's experience from static absorption to dynamic exploration, a key characteristic of augmented text. By manipulating the elements within the articles, readers gain a hands-on understanding, which can be particularly effective for educational purposes.

The relevance of these articles to the thesis lies in their ability to demystify complex subjects, making them accessible to a broader audience. This is achieved not through oversimplification but through the power of interactive visualizations that work in concert with the written content. Each article presents an opportunity to analyze how text and interactive elements can be blended to create an enhanced reading experience.

As the thesis advocates for augmented text as a means of responsive communication, Ciechanowski's work can serve as a case study for implementing such principles effectively. It demonstrates how augmented text can provide clarity and insight into topics that might otherwise be impenetrable to those without specialized knowledge. The integration of these examples into the thesis will not only support the argument for augmented text but will also provide a practical framework for its application.

This exploration will culminate in a discussion of the design and educational philosophies underpinning Ciechanowski's work. The insights gleaned from this analysis will contribute to the development of a set of guidelines for creating augmented text, ensuring that such text is not only informative but also engaging and capable of fostering a deeper level of understanding.

By examining the archives of Ciechanowski, the thesis will bridge the gap between theoretical exploration and practical application, illustrating how augmented text can be used to create powerful and educational narratives. The section will underscore the importance of such work in the evolution of digital communication, positioning it as an integral component of the pattern library that others can draw upon for their own explorations of augmented text.

**"Homestuck": A Multi-Modal Marvel**

Andrew Hussie's 'Homestuck' (Hussie, n.d.) is a webcomic that delights in transcending traditional boundaries and defying categorisation. It is a unique blend of illustration, text, interactive games, and videos, creating a multi-modal experience that engages readers on multiple levels. The narrative is not confined to static images and words on a page; it spills into interactive Flash games, YouTube videos, and even physical merchandise. Hussie's creation doesn't just adhere to the grain of conventional storytelling but revels in exploring the myriad possibilities of digital media. This makes "Homestuck" not merely a webcomic but an expansive narrative universe that invites active participation and exploration.

https://www.homestuck.net/meta/analysis.html

**Web Alternate Reality Games (ARGs)**

The concept of web Alternate Reality Games (ARGs) further expands on this idea of multi-modal storytelling. ARGs blur the lines between fiction and reality, offering immersive experiences that extend beyond traditional media. Players interact with the game through various channels such as websites, social media, phone calls, and real-world events. Clues are dropped everywhere, and players must actively engage with the content, often collaborating with others, to unravel the story. The game is not confined to a single platform or format; it permeates the player's reality, turning the entire world into a playground.

**"LOST": Transmedia Storytelling**

The popular TV show "LOST" explored this space of transmedia storytelling by creating an ARG that accompanied the series. Beyond the television screen, "LOST" fans could delve into websites, fake commercials, and other media that expanded the show's universe. These additional layers of content provided deeper insights into the characters and mysteries of the show, allowing fans to actively participate in the narrative. This approach went against the grain of traditional television watching, turning passive viewers into active participants in a broader storytelling experience. Miller, Vandome, and McBrewster (2009) have explored the ways that internet culture and interactivity began influencing our media landscape in the new century, a trend that has only accelerated since then.

**The New Horizon:**

The initiatives by Google, Nicky Case, Bartosz Ciechanowski, and the broader movement towards Explorable Explanations and Multiverses herald a new era of communication and education. They challenge the status quo, inviting us to reimagine how we interact with information and ideas. It's a shift from static to dynamic, from passive to active, and from siloed to interconnected. As we step into this new horizon, the potential for creating more engaging, insightful, and impactful learning experiences is boundless. These innovations are not just a glimpse into the future of education and communication; they are a call to action for creators, educators, and learners to embrace the interactive, exploratory nature of the digital realm.

The storytelling approaches in "Homestuck" and "LOST" ARGs demonstrate a multi-modal narrative experience that transcends traditional media boundaries. Augmented Text aligns with this innovative spirit but remains anchored in the written word. It takes cues from these multi-modal approaches to create a layered narrative experience, where text is not just a vessel for story but an active participant in the narrative journey. Augmented Text, in this context, becomes a medium where the storytelling grain is both respected and expanded, offering new dimensions to narrative construction and reader engagement.

**Tying It All Together**

Both "Homestuck" and the ARG elements of "LOST" represent a new frontier in storytelling, one that embraces the interconnectedness and flexibility of modern media. They demonstrate that the grain of storytelling is not fixed or rigid but can be shaped, stretched, and reimagined to create rich and engaging experiences. By weaving together various media and allowing readers or viewers to actively engage with the content, creators can build immersive worlds that transcend the limitations of traditional formats. This multi-modal approach to storytelling is not just an innovation; it's a celebration of the endless possibilities of artistic expression in the digital age. Whether through the sprawling narrative of "Homestuck" or the layered mystery of "LOST," these works challenge us to rethink what storytelling can be and invite us to participate in shaping its future.

As we embrace the new horizon of digital interactivity and exploration heralded by the works of Google, Nicky Case, and others, Augmented Text stands as a testament to this evolving landscape. It represents a synthesis of these innovative approaches, offering a unique blend of interactivity and traditional reading. Augmented Text is not just a continuation of the digital evolution in communication and education; it's a leap forward, offering a medium that is dynamic, interactive, and deeply connected to the evolving needs and habits of its audience.
