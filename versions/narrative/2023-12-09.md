# Augmented Text

<DocumentStats /> 

### Abstract

The history of human communication started with speech, evolved to include written history, and in modern times added hyperlinks. Since then, the experience of reading text hasn't seen much improvement. In this paper, I’ll survey the state of multimedia today and explain why augmented text addresses scenarios and needs that are unaddressable with traditional multimedia alone.

# Introducing Augmented Text

<DancingAboutArchitecture />

Let's ponder this for a moment—the little 'Explain Like I'm Five' feature you just witnessed is a tiny marvel that traditional books can't replicate. In a conventional book, you might awkwardly flip back and forth between an advanced explanation and a simplified one, but it's clunky and doesn't really flow. And what if we want to adapt the text even further? Imagine trying to accommodate someone with dyslexia by altering the font, or shielding a reader from content they find distressing. In a printed world, this would mean a bookshelf groaning under the weight of variants—hardly practical.

Now, swing to the other end of the spectrum—transforming each of these functionalities into standalone apps. The very thought is enough to make you baulk. Should you really need to download a new app for every book you read, or every essay you dive into? Even if these apps came packed with every conceivable feature, the sheer bulk would make them unwieldy, stripping the joy from the act of reading. This is where the elegance of augmented text shines through.

At its heart, augmented text is about preserving the simplicity and joy of reading while discreetly weaving in layers of interactivity—those small, targeted, helpful assistants. These digital companions are nimble, unobtrusive, and responsive to our individual needs, whether it's flipping the complexity of language with a single click or changing the visual presentation for accessibility. They're there when you need them, invisible when you don't, enhancing our understanding without overshadowing the text itself.

Think of augmented text as a book that listens and responds to you, the reader. It's the bridge between the static page and the dynamic world of digital possibilities. A world where text is no longer just ink on paper but a living, breathing entity that adapts to the unique needs of its reader. It's a world where the barriers to understanding are lowered, not by replacing the book, but by enhancing it in ways that were once the domain of science fiction.

And that's what this paper will explore—how augmented text takes the timeless act of reading and imbues it with the adaptability of the digital age. Just as a chameleon changes its colors to suit its environment, augmented text reshapes itself to suit the reader's needs. It's reading, reimagined for a world where the written word is no longer static, but dynamic; not fixed, but fluid; not one-size-fits-all, but personalized. It's a quiet revolution, a gentle augmentation of the reading experience that promises to make it richer, more accessible, and infinitely more adaptable.
### Augmented Text's core principles

**1. Seamless Blending:** Augmented text should integrate naturally and unobtrusively into the narrative, merging interactive elements into the reading experience in a way that feels intuitive and harmonious.

**2. Concise Enhancement:** Augmented text is intended to complement, not overpower, the written word. It aims to enrich the narrative with targeted, succinct additions, adding depth while maintaining the integrity and fluency of the text.

These principles will serve as our benchmarks as we examine augmented text in various contexts, such as gaming and data visualization. We will assess how well these innovations adhere to the ideals of seamless blending and concise enhancement in enhancing written communication.

Before we dive into the specifics of augmented text and its potential to transform our reading experiences, it's important to understand the context from which it arises. Let's pause to survey the landscape of human communication that stretches behind us, from the oral traditions of our distant ancestors to the written word's evolution. This retrospective will lay the groundwork for appreciating augmented text as not just a novelty, but as the next logical step in the journey of storytelling and information sharing. So let's begin by tracing the lineage of our communicative practices, setting the stage for the innovations that augmented text represents.

### In the beginning, there were words

The story of human communication is one of remarkable consistency threaded through an evolving tapestry of technology. Ancient methods of storytelling, whether through oral traditions or the earliest written texts, served purposes that remain central to modern communication: to inform, to entertain, to persuade, and to connect. This story arc in the thesis will trace these enduring threads from past to present, illustrating how augmented text is not a departure from traditional communication but a continuation and enhancement of it. I'll also explore why multimedia has stayed mostly static for decades, other than the addition of hypertext.

Ancient storytellers around campfires captivated their audiences with narratives that would linger in memory, much like modern podcasts or TED Talks aim to do today. The transition from oral to written communication, marked by the creation of cuneiform, mirrors the transition from printed to digital text. In both shifts, the core function of preserving and sharing knowledge remained unchanged, even as the methods became more sophisticated and accessible.

Similarly, the printing press revolutionised the distribution of information, a role now taken up by the internet. Yet the goal has always been the same: to disseminate knowledge as widely as possible. The content explosion enabled by smartphones and the web has its roots in the democratisation of knowledge that began with Gutenberg's invention.

This arc within the thesis will draw attention to the parallels between old and new, emphasising that while the tools and technologies evolve, the fundamental human need for communication remains. Augmented text, with its interactive and multimedia capabilities, is simply the latest iteration in this continuum. It takes the essence of what has always been important in communication—clarity, engagement, and accessibility—and builds upon it with the benefits afforded by modern technology that we're missing out on by not re-evaluating the experience of reading and improving it to keep pace with how people read in modern contexts.

By weaving this story arc through the thesis, I'll prove that augmented text is not an outlier in the history of communication but a natural progression. It embodies the same principles that have driven the development of communication methods for millennia, now empowered by digital interactivity and the global reach of the internet. This perspective will serve to situate augmented text within a broader historical context, demonstrating its relevance and potential as the next step in the ongoing journey of human expression.

**Let's get specific**

When our ancient ancestors told stories around the fire, they were keeping records for later, passing stories and insights down via oral tradition. This innate drive for communication aligns with Noam Chomsky’s linguistic theories, which suggest that language is an inherent trait hardwired into our neural architecture. Chomsky introduced the idea of a "universal grammar," an inborn set of structural rules common to all languages, implying that the capacity for language is not learned but biologically inscribed. This brought significant benefits to human civilisation, but it wasn’t until the invention of writing that communication was able to evolve from hearsay to something more tangible and verifiable.

Around 3400 BC, Sumerian scribes in Mesopotamia laid the groundwork for the first known form of written communication, called cuneiform. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform) This intricate system of wedge-shaped marks pressed into clay tablets allowed the recording of inventories, laws, and narratives, marking a significant improvement around how humankind preserved and disseminated knowledge. This allowed information to outlive its author and be shared with audiences for the first time. The impact of this technology cannot be overstated; it's easily on par with the invention of the wheel and fire, and was the precursor, however humbly, to the modern reading experience we experience today.

Tablets were a good start, but they were hardly portable. This lead to the invention of paper by the Chinese around the 1st century AD. Then the printing press, invented by Johannes Gutenberg in 15th century Europe, took the revolution a step further by making the process easier and widely available. Knowledge was no longer the exclusive domain of the affluent and the clergy; it was accessible to anyone who could read. Like cuneiform and paper before it, this technology permanently changed the way humanity communicated, and the resulting impact, again, cannot be overstated.

The evolution from spoken word to written, then from expensive to cheap, set up the desktop and internet revolutions of the late 20th century, followed by the explosion of smartphone usage, which made communication as cheap and plentiful as it’s ever been. Today, the combination of the internet and mobile means we've never had more content, in reach of as many people (both in absolute terms and per capita), being produced by more people. Yet the technology we're using to communicate multimedia concepts has stayed surprisingly static for the last 50 years.

We used to speak around campfires, whereas now we record podcasts, shoot Instagram stories, and record video chats. But at their heart, it's all just verbal communication. We used to write stories, first on caves, then on tablets, then on paper. Now we've added websites, status updates, ebooks, and group texts, but and their heart, they're all just textual communication. You can tell the same stories about music and video; music has always been music, even as the technology powering them changes and evolves. Movies have always been movies, whether black and white, full colour, 3d, or VR. And the consumption experiences for all have stayed largely the same as well. We still watch movies and plays in theatres, we still listen to music on our own or as part of a group concert. We still watch people tell stories, whether around a campfire, on YouTube, or at a stand-up comedy show. The more things change, the more they stay the same.

By perceiving modern digital formats like the Kindle, YouTube videos, or online news stories as mere digital versions of their traditional counterparts, we risk missing opportunities for more impactful communication. This oversight is akin to the initial limitations of early websites and TV shows, which merely replicated existing physical and broadcast formats. This phenomenon highlights the importance of seamlessly blending new technologies with traditional media. Just as it took time for television to evolve from the simplicity of "I Love Lucy" to the complexity of "Game of Thrones," our understanding and use of digital media are continually evolving. Storytelling remains constant, but the methods of delivery can and should be enhanced to be both concise in conveying the essence and seamless in integration with new technologies.

The realm of interactive media and multimedia, while often static in its approach, contrasts with the dynamic nature of games, which have consistently been a fertile ground for interactive innovations. This raises a crucial question: Can elements from gaming be integrated seamlessly with traditional communication forms in a way that enhances rather than complicates the narrative? The answer is nuanced, and this exploration will delve into how gaming elements can be incorporated concisely and seamlessly into augmented text. Our aim is to explore how these interactive components can enrich the storytelling experience without overwhelming the core message, adhering to the principles of augmented text.

# A Failure of Imagination: The Limitations of Contemporary Multimedia

To understand how contemporary multimedia is created, imagine writing a blog post in a large media organisation. What forms of media would be in your multimedia toolkit?

- Text input
- Links
- Images
- Video

And that's it. If you want to add something as simple as a gallery or slideshow of photos, you require a special widget or component. In most cases, this request would require special knowledge from someone with the right experience to offer it. (This is reminiscent of how early versions of the bible were only decipherable by highly educated people in the church, requiring average people to ask for help.) What if you want to show a comparison between two images, perhaps to show a before and after image of the effects of hurricane? Again, you'd be out of luck without someone coding the component for you. Or what if you wanted to provide some light interactivity to help explain a complex concept? Not possible unless you can explain it in text, images, or maybe a video. It's hard to argue that "text, sometimes with an image embedded in it," really counts as interactive multimedia. It's pretty close to reading a magazine or newspaper from 100 years ago, the only difference being that it's delivered over the internet, to a screen, with hyperlinks, and sometimes with an embedded video.

On the other end of the interactive spectrum, we have video games, a media type categorisation so broad as to be meaningless. One could make the argument that the subject matter addressed by games is even more vast than the entire collected works of books in all of human recorded history. The difference is in interactivity. Romeo and Juliet is just another love story, but if you played Romeo and Juliet as a simulated experience, you could drive the story however you want. By definition, a book will have one ending. By definition, many games will be expected to have multiple endings, multiple paths to get there, and a sense of autonomy that makes each experience necessarily different from anyone else's experience. Citizen Kane is an epic movie about a legendary character. A single interactive product like World of Warcraft aims to provide multiple storylines just as epic and personalised as Citizen Kane to the more than 100 million people who have played it. In terms of sheer quantity, there's no contest which experience provides a wider range of experiences.

But quantity isn't the only metric, of course. When you're reading a news article, you're not seeking a game of pinball. When you're playing Minecraft, you're not seeking to read a 300 page book of lore. As Frank Chimero demonstrated in Grain of the Web, effective communication with text and media requires using the right tool for the job. Just as you wouldn't use a screwdriver to hammer a nail, or rely on interpretative dance to critique some architecture, an essay doesn't work as well as a series of images. A comic wouldn’t work as well described orally. A painting wasn’t meant to be a video. There is a “grain” to each media type that guides authors towards how to best use them, and if you go against the grain, they are less effective. The key to successful design and communication is to work within the space. I propose that multimedia artists have gotten complacent, where we have simple CMS systems for writing with text + images and overly complex game authoring environments for anything more complex than text. There's a vast space in between those extremes that warrants a closer look. To date, the closest word most people have used to describe this space is "simulation."

Simulations live between full-fledged games and traditional written content. They provide a bridge between the static and the interactive, allowing users to manipulate variables and observe the outcomes. This makes simulations particularly effective for demonstrating complex systems or processes that would be difficult to explain with text or images alone. For example, in the context of climate science, a simulation could allow users to increase or decrease greenhouse gas emissions and observe the effects on global temperature, sea level, and more. The interactivity of simulations supports active learning, as users can explore the system or process at their own pace, experimenting with different scenarios and seeing the results. This helps users to understand not just what happens, but why it happens, deepening their understanding and knowledge retention. This is not a new field, but it's one that's been poorly defined and advocated for for many years. The closest we've come in the popular imagination is when Bret Victor identified this spectrum of communication and coined the term “Explorable Explanations” to describe products that live in the middle of the two extremes: written content that uses interactive components to communicate concepts more effectively. That's where we'll be focusing next.

### “Explorable Explanations” and “Active Essays”

Bret Victor introduced the concept of Explorable Explanations to offer a new way of presenting and interacting with text. The core idea is to transform text from mere information to be consumed into an "environment to think in." (TODO: ADD FOOTNOTE) This was envisioned as an umbrella project with the goal of encouraging truly active reading. To make abstract concepts more concrete, Victor proposed the development of reactive documents that allow readers to manipulate authors' assumptions and see the consequences, explorable examples that make abstract concepts concrete, and contextual information that allows readers to learn related material just-in-time and cross-check the author's claims.

(IMG TODO: ADD A BRETT VICTOR EXAMPLE HERE)

Victor's ideas, however, were not completely new. Computing pioneer Alan Kay had previously discussed the concept of active essays which blended computer-based simulations with explanatory text. This was a part of his vision for transforming the computer into a new kind of medium for creative thought, combining the dynamic and interactive nature of the computer with the narrative and argumentative strength of the essay.

These ideas have led to a surge of explorations in the field. Notably, Nicky Case has been instrumental in bringing these ideas to life. One notable example is "Parable of the Polygons", a web-based interactive simulation game that visually demonstrates how small individual biases can lead to large collective biases, thus providing an explorable explanation of systemic societal biases.

(IMG TODO: ADD A VISUAL HERE, ALSO EXPLAIN WHY IMAGES AREN'T ENOUGH)

By 2012, Explorable explanations were gaining momentum, as authors in education, journalism, and data science began to see the potential these interactive tools had for transforming their fields. Educators were recognizing the value of engaging students in a more active role, where critical thinking was not just encouraged but required. Journalists, on platforms such as Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight, were starting to experiment with these tools, using them to elucidate complex datasets and statistical models, allowing their readers to interact with and digest intricate information through hands-on exploration.

Yet, despite these burgeoning explorations, there was a lingering challenge in defining what exactly constituted an explorable explanation. Was it distinct from a simulation, a game, or an interactive educational tool? The boundaries remained blurred. It was difficult to pinpoint a single instance that encapsulated the entire concept until "Snowfall" arrived and set a new benchmark. It was a traditional article, not an embedded video or interactive demo, but the careful and innovative touches of interactivity they added hit the collective imagination as something new and useful. And not juts that, it won a Pulitizer.

### The Importance of Snowfall

Steve Duenes
Andrew Kueneman

When The New York Times released the "Snow Fall" interactive feature in 2012, it sparked waves of excitement within the digital media industry. This unprecedented piece of multimedia storytelling, a long-form article punctuated by interactive graphics, videos, and immersive animations, seemed to herald the dawn of a new era for online media. Snowfall was a trailblazer, representing a powerful blend of traditional journalistic storytelling and interactive elements, promising an engaging and immersive reader experience.

The innovative approach of Snowfall was met with critical acclaim, winning the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing. Its influence was quickly seen in the proliferation of 'Snowfall-like' features across the digital media landscape, as news outlets and other media organisations sought to emulate its success. The term 'Snowfall' even became a verb within the industry, describing the process of creating rich, multimedia experiences within a long-form article.

However, the initial enthusiasm surrounding Snowfall was soon tempered. Despite the benefits of the new format, it was still hard to use, buggy, and complicated. The production of Snowfall was a costly endeavour, both in terms of time and resources. It required a team of skilled developers and designers working intensively over several months to bring the project to fruition. This high level of investment was not a feasible model for most media outlets, particularly for those with smaller budgets or shorter timelines.

Furthermore, the feature was not without technical issues. Users reported numerous bugs, with interactive elements often failing to load properly or behaving inconsistently across different devices and browsers. The high-quality multimedia content, while visually impressive, was also demanding on system resources, leading to slow load times and performance issues for users with less powerful computers or slower internet connections.

The conundrum posed by "Snowfall" is far from unique in the annals of technological innovation. History is replete with pioneering ideas that have stumbled at the crossroads of potential and practicality. Take, for example, the early days of virtual reality in the 1990s. The promise of immersive digital worlds was alluring, but the reality was clunky headsets, nausea-inducing graphics, and prohibitive costs. It was a future glimpsed but not grasped, the technology not yet ripe for widespread adoption.

Similarly, consider the first generation of electric cars. They hinted at a revolution in personal transport, whispering of a cleaner, more efficient future. Yet, they were beset by limited range, lengthy charging times, and a scarcity of infrastructure. These vehicles carried the seeds of a greener tomorrow, but they were planted in the unforgiving soil of today's limitations.

Both these examples underscore the uneven distribution of the future, a phenomenon eloquently encapsulated by writer William Gibson's observation that "The future is already here — it's just not very evenly distributed." "Snowfall" was another manifestation of this truth. Its vision for a new storytelling paradigm was clear, but the tools and systems necessary for its realization were not yet in place for everyone. The challenge, then, as with all emerging technologies, was to close the gap between the vanguard of innovation and the trailing edge of accessibility. It was about finding scalable, efficient, and economically viable ways to deliver the rich potential of interactive media to all users, regardless of their technological or financial circumstances. The road from potential to ubiquity is rarely a straight line; it is a winding path marked by iteration, refinement, and the gradual democratization of once-exclusive technologies.

### The Snowfall backlash (The Grain of the Web)

In 2015, three years post "Snowfall," Frank Chimero published "The Web's Grain," an insightful reflection on web design and digital interaction. Without directly mentioning "Snowfall," Chimero struck a chord with developers wrestling with similar issues. His concept of "grain" in media products, borrowed from the craft of woodworking, articulated a truth many sensed but hadn't named—it's the intrinsic nature of materials that should guide our creations.

Chimero's "grain" speaks to the inherent properties of any medium. Just as wood has a direction to its fibers that informs a carpenter's work, digital mediums have an inherent "grain" that should guide design. The most harmonious digital experiences, Chimero suggests, are those crafted in sync with the web’s flexible, interconnected nature, respecting its "edgelessness" or the absence of strict confines.

Snowfall, while innovative, arguably bucked against the web's grain. Its ambition outstripped its execution, becoming a resource-heavy behemoth that often stumbled across the varied landscape of devices and browsers. It lacked the fluidity and adaptability that Chimero identified as hallmarks of the web's true nature. This pioneering project was indeed a spectacle, but one that perhaps flew too close to the sun, revealing the delicate balance between innovation and the current technological reach. It underscored the necessity for digital creations to not only push boundaries but also to move in harmony with the ever-evolving digital ecosystem.

Chimero might argue that this approach ran counter to the web's inherent fluidity and adaptability. While the project harnessed some of the web's potential for rich multimedia storytelling, its complex design and performance issues revealed a misalignment with the web's grain.

Yet, despite these flaws, the concept behind Snowfall aligns with Chimero's vision of embracing the web's unique capacities. The New York Times's interactive feature represents an attempt to leverage the web's potential for creating immersive, interconnected experiences that transcend traditional linear storytelling. Even though its execution was not perfect, the ambition and innovation behind Snowfall signalled a step towards more engaging and interactive forms of online content.

Chimero’s essay urges us to step back from the precipice of overcomplicated, overly-ambitious design and to reconsider the fundamental properties of the web – a more versatile, flexible and inherently complex medium than any that have come before. This call for a return to simplicity, however, is not a call for stagnation or resistance against innovation. Rather, it is a challenge to embrace the medium in its fullness, harness its unique properties, and wield these attributes to push the boundaries of digital storytelling.

Seen through this lens, "Snowfall" isn’t so much a failed experiment, but an important milestone that stretched the conceptual limits of online communication. It unveiled a tantalising glimpse of the web’s potential while laying bare the challenges of aligning with the web’s unique grain. This experience showed us the value in creating digital narratives that are innovative, accessible, and engaging – narratives that ride with the web's grain rather than against it.

The promise of Snowfall, then, isn't in the specific form it took but rather the vision it represented – a vision of using the web's unique capacities for storytelling, learning, and understanding. It's about blending the strengths of the medium with content, not wedging content into unwieldy software experiences.

However, to translate this vision into practice, we need to focus on what makes online documents successful: text, video, images, and embedded widgets. These components are not just passive containers of information, but dynamic instruments of communication, each with its unique way of engaging users and conveying meaning.

In addition to these, we introduce the concept of responsive communication - an innovative approach that focuses on enhancing comprehension and interactivity. To truly harness the web's grain, we must design digital experiences that respond to users' actions and adapt to their needs. These can range from interactive diagrams that users can manipulate to gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter, to smart annotations that provide additional information on demand, to simulations that allow users to explore different scenarios and outcomes.

These components create a more holistic and immersive experience. They do not function as separate, disconnected pieces wedged into a page but as a cohesive whole. They become a part of the narrative, supplementing and enhancing the main text rather than distracting from it.

But, as we move towards embracing these new tools and approaches, we must not lose sight of the core of all communication: words. The fundamental purpose of any digital communication, no matter how visually stunning or interactively engaging, is to convey meaning through content.

Therefore, we propose creating a component library - a collection of versatile, reusable components that seamlessly integrate into the narrative flow, enhancing the storytelling and learning process. A tool like this allows us to avoid the pitfall of over-complication, keeping us grounded in our ultimate goal: to communicate effectively.

In essence, our journey from Snowfall, through The Web's Grain, and back to words represents a shift in our understanding and approach to digital storytelling. It's about recognising the unique grain of the web and using it to create more meaningful, effective, and engaging experiences. It's about finding that sweet spot between innovation and accessibility, where the technology enhances the narrative rather than overwhelming it.

### Innovating from Inspiration

Innovation within and beyond the grain is an exciting frontier in the exploration of text as a medium. Whether adhering to the grain or boldly defying it, creators have the opportunity to craft meaningful, engaging, and transformative experiences. From the artistic experimentation of "House of Leaves" to the multi-modal storytelling of "Homestuck," the adaptive evolution of music, the intricate puzzles of web ARGs, and the ongoing exploration of digital text, the journey is filled with potential.

It's about striking a balance between tradition and innovation, resonance and dissonance, familiarity and novelty. It's about recognising the grain, understanding its limitations, and pushing its boundaries. It's about building not just the song but also the concert hall, not just the words but also the world in which they live.

The challenge and opportunity lie in our willingness to explore, to question, to experiment, and to innovate. The grain of the medium is not a constraint but a starting point, a foundation upon which we can build, expand, and reimagine. The future of text is a canvas waiting to be painted, a story waiting to be told, a grain waiting to be explored. Whether it's a multi-layered digital comic, a groundbreaking television show, or a novel that defies conventional reading, the potential is vast, and the grain is ripe for exploration. So let's explore!

### Example: **Digital Patina**

<DigitalPatina format="embed" />

What it is:

Digital patina refers to design elements that change over time to reflect usage, akin to how physical objects acquire a patina with age. This can take many forms on a website, such as a colour change on frequently-clicked buttons or wear marks on often-viewed pages.

Why it's better than simple text:

Digital patina adds a layer of interaction and personalisation that simple text can't provide, making the user experience more engaging and visually interesting.

Why it's better than launching a widget:

Digital patina is integrated into the design of the page or site, subtly enhancing the user experience without the need for launching separate widgets.

Notable examples:

(BBC example from 2003 or so)

Inventors: BBC perhaps?

### Example: Personal breadcrumbs


<PersonalBreadcrumbs format="embed" />
### Example: **Last Read Indicator**

<LastReadIndicator format="embed" />

What it is:

A 'last read' indicator is a tool that marks the last point in a text that a user read, allowing them to pick up where they left off when they return to the document.

Notable examples: (look for some)

Why it's better than simple text:

Reading long documents can be daunting, and it's easy to lose your place. The 'last read' indicator solves this problem by providing a visual bookmark, enhancing usability.

Why it's better than launching a widget:

The indicator is built into the document, meaning it's always present and doesn't interrupt the reading experience. There's no need to launch a separate tool or navigate away from the page.

Inventors: probably none?

### Example: Reference labels


<ReferenceLabels format="embed" />
### Example: **Article Diff**

<ArticleDiff format="embed" />

What it is:

An 'article diff' tool allows users to compare different versions of an article or document, showing the additions, deletions, and modifications between them. This is similar to the 'track changes' feature in word processing software but integrated into the web interface.

Notable examples:

Wikipedia uses a similar feature to track changes in its pages, while GitHub uses it for tracking changes in code.

Why it's better than simple text:

It provides an efficient way to see the evolution of a document or the changes made, beyond what could be communicated through text alone.

Why it's better than launching a widget:

An 'article diff' is directly incorporated into the webpage, meaning users can instantly access and navigate the changes without the need to load a separate tool or application.

Inventors:

The concept is borrowed from programming, where 'diff' tools have long been used to compare different versions of code.

### Example: **Before and After Slider**

<BeforeAndAfterSlider format="embed" />

What it is:

A 'before and after' slider is a visual tool that allows users to compare two versions of an image by sliding a control left and right. It can reveal changes, contrasts, or progress over time in a way that is immediate and striking.

Notable examples:

This tool has been used effectively in various fields, including journalism, where The New York Times has used it to show the impacts of natural disasters on landscapes, and in retail, where it's used to demonstrate the effects of products.

Why it's better than simple text:

Text can describe differences, but the slider allows for a visual, direct comparison that can be more impactful and easier to grasp. It's a concrete, visual way to present contrasts or changes.

Why it's better than launching a widget:

The slider is incorporated directly into the page, offering a seamless experience. There's no need to open a separate widget or leave the current context, ensuring the flow of information remains uninterrupted.

Inventors: The exact origin is unclear, but it's a widely-used tool in web development, with many open-source versions available.


### Example: **Interactive Numbers**

<InteractiveNumbers format="embed" />
<InteractiveNumbers format="embed" />

An interactive graph for compound interest visualizes how an initial investment grows over time, taking into account both the initial deposit and the accumulated interest. Users can manipulate variables (like interest rate, time, or initial deposit) to see how changes impact the growth of the investment.

Why it's better than simple text:

Text explanations of compound interest can be abstract and hard to grasp. An interactive graph makes the concept concrete and allows users to experiment and see the impact of different variables directly.

Why it's better than launching a widget: Embedding the interactive graph into the page keeps the user in the context of the broader content, maintaining the flow of information and engagement.

Notable examples:

Various financial and educational websites use interactive compound interest calculators, such as Investopedia and Khan Academy. (Sorted.co.nz?)

Inventors:

The concept of an interactive compound interest graph likely arose with the advent of financial technology tools designed to educate and engage consumers in personal finance.


### Example: **Summarise Widget**


<SummariseWidget format="embed" />
What it is:

A 'summarise' widget is a tool that automatically generates a concise summary of a larger text. This could be a paragraph that summarises an article, key points from a speech, or the main ideas of a chapter, for instance.

Why it's better than simple text:

It provides a quick way to understand the main points of a long text, offering a 'digest' version for those short on time or seeking to preview the content.

Why it's better than launching a widget:

The summarise widget can be built directly into the webpage, immediately available to the user without interrupting their reading flow.

Notable examples:

Some online learning platforms use this tool to provide summaries of lengthy lectures or course materials.

Inventors:

Summarisation technology has been developed by many companies and researchers in the field of natural language processing and machine learning.


### Example: **Cite Pull-Forward**

<CitePullForward format="embed" />

What it is:

A 'cite pull-forward' is a feature that brings citation information (such as the author, publication date, or source title) into the main body of text when you hover over or click on an in-text citation. It provides an easy way for readers to check sources without leaving their place in the text.

Why it's better than simple text:

It provides an instant, convenient way for readers to verify and understand the context of information, improving transparency and trust in the content.

Why it's better than launching a widget:

The 'cite pull-forward' function maintains the reader's engagement and focus, offering a smoother reading experience compared to having to navigate to a separate widget or the end of the document for the full citation.

Notable examples:

Some academic databases and journal websites incorporate a similar feature, improving the reading experience for researchers.

Inventors: (I think the guy who thinks AI will kill us all did this first?)




# With the Grain: Where Augmented Text Fits


### The Grain of Games

In the world of digital games, the concept of "grain" can also be applied to understand the inherent nature and purpose of different game genres. Just as Frank Chimero described the grain of the web, games have an innate tendency and purpose that guide their design and player experience. When a game's design aligns with its grain, it creates a cohesive and immersive experience. Conversely, going against the grain can lead to disjointed and unsettling gameplay.

**Minecraft: A Sandbox with Limits**

Take the example of Minecraft, a sandbox game that allows players an almost unlimited freedom to build, explore, and create within a pixelated world. Its grain lies in the open-ended nature of exploration and creativity. Players can construct vast cities, intricate machines, or even write simple texts within the game. However, this grain has its limits.

Imagine being tasked with reading an entire novel within Minecraft. Though technically possible, this would be a jarring experience that goes against the grain of the game. Minecraft's environment is not conducive to long-form reading. The blocky aesthetics, navigation mechanics, and interactive dynamics are not designed to provide a comfortable or engaging reading experience. The novel's presence in the game would feel unnatural and dissonant, as it conflicts with the inherent tendencies of the game to provide spatial and tactile exploration.

**Visual Novels: When Games Meet Literature**

Visual novels, on the other hand, provide a unique intersection of gaming and reading. They are designed to offer interactive storytelling experiences, where players make choices that guide the narrative. Here, the grain is a blend of reading and light interactivity, where the emphasis is on narrative immersion rather than complex gameplay mechanics.

Now, imagine if a visual novel suddenly transitioned into a fast-paced action game without warning. This shift would be jolting and might feel inappropriate within the context of the story. It would go against the grain of what a visual novel is meant to be. The player is prepared for a reading experience with decision-making, not an intense battle requiring rapid reflexes.

**Embracing the Grain**

The examples of Minecraft and visual novels illustrate that understanding the grain of a game is essential to creating a harmonious player experience. When developers recognise and work with the grain, they can create games that feel intuitive and engaging. Straying from this grain can lead to confusion, discomfort, or dissatisfaction.

This is not to say that experimentation and innovation should be avoided. Games can and should push boundaries, explore new concepts, and challenge conventions. However, these explorations should be done with a mindful understanding of the grain and how it shapes player expectations and experiences.

In essence, the grain of a game is a compass that guides design decisions, helping to align the game's mechanics, aesthetics, and interactivity with its core purpose. Recognising and embracing this grain enables designers to create experiences that resonate with players, offering them journeys that feel natural, engaging, and deeply satisfying. Conversely, going against the grain without thoughtful consideration can lead to a dissonance that disrupts the player's connection to the game, undermining its impact and appeal.

The lessons learned from understanding the grain in games can also be applied to other mediums and disciplines, including web design and multimedia storytelling. It's a concept that transcends boundaries, offering insights into how we can create more resonant and effective experiences across various platforms and formats. It's about finding that harmony between form and function, where the medium enhances the message rather than working against it.

**Incorporating the History of Text Games into Augmented Text**

In considering the history of human communication, the role of text games over the past half-century offers a fascinating lens through which to view the evolution of interactive storytelling. Text games, or interactive fiction, represent a bridge between traditional narrative forms and the interactive digital experiences that are central to the concept of augmented text. These games have turned readers into players, actively engaging them in the story's progression through text-based inputs and branching paths.


From the early days of mainframe computers to the contemporary scene, text games have provided a unique storytelling medium where the narrative unfolds based on the player's choices. This interactivity represents an early form of augmented text, where the reader is not a passive consumer but an active participant in the communication process. Games like "Zork," "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," and more recent titles such as "80 Days" have shown that text can be a playground for the imagination, providing a space for readers to explore and influence the story.

The potential of text games in the context of augmented text is their demonstrated ability to engage users in a narrative. They compel the reader to take an active role, to make decisions that have consequences within the story, thus providing a deeper level of engagement than static text. By examining the development of text games, the thesis can draw parallels between these interactive narratives and the principles of augmented text. It can show how the engagement strategies developed in text games can inform the design of augmented text, making it more dynamic and responsive.



In the broader narrative of your thesis, the history and impact of text games underscore the potential for text to evolve beyond static words on a page. They exemplify how text can be the foundation for rich, interactive experiences that resonate with readers on a deeper level. This history also highlights the creativity and innovation that writers and developers have poured into expanding the boundaries of storytelling.

Incorporating the history of text games into the thesis provides historical context for the evolution of augmented text and demonstrates the longstanding human desire to interact with narratives. It reflects on how far we have come in storytelling technology and sets the stage for discussing the future possibilities that augmented text holds.

### The Grain of Dataviz

Data visualisation represents a powerful tool for communicating complex information, trends, and insights in an accessible and compelling manner. The field experienced a significant surge in popularity in the early 2000s, largely thanks to the pioneering work of Edward Tufte. Tufte's groundbreaking books, including "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information" and "Envisioning Information," have inspired countless designers and analysts to explore the potential of visual communication, especially in the context of charts and graphs.

**Embracing the Grain: Tufte's Vision**

Tufte's philosophy emphasised maximising the data-ink ratio, putting more data points into visual communication without unnecessary decorations or embellishments. He advocated for clarity, simplicity, and integrity in design, recognising the unique grain of data visualisation as a medium for conveying quantitative information efficiently and effectively.



This approach has led to some remarkable examples of data visualisation. Sites like 538 and pudding.cool have become renowned for their innovative and insightful visualisations, harnessing the grain of data to offer readers deeper understanding and engagement with complex topics.

**Going Against the Grain: Poor Imitations**

However, the popularity of data visualisation has also led to a proliferation of poor imitations that go against the grain of what the medium is meant to accomplish. These misguided attempts often miss the essence of data visualisation, reducing it to mere graphic design projects without considering the underlying purpose and potential of the medium.

Many bad visualisations seem to prioritise style over substance, obscuring the data's meaning behind flashy visuals, confusing layouts, or unnecessary complexity. In some cases, the information could be more clearly and effectively communicated through simple bullet points or concise text. These examples fail to leverage the unique properties of data visualisation, losing the opportunity to enhance comprehension and insight.

For example, a chart that employs a bewildering array of colours, shapes, and lines without clear labelling or logical organisation can confuse rather than clarify. Such a chart might look visually appealing but fails to convey the intended message or insights, leaving readers frustrated and uninformed.

**Tufte's Misstep: Redesigning the iPhone Stocks App**

Even Tufte himself, the champion of data-rich visualisations, made a notable misstep when he attempted to redesign the iPhone stocks app. His design was guided by his traditional approach of maximising data density, without considering the specific context and constraints of mobile design.

The result was a cluttered and overwhelming interface that went against the grain of what mobile users typically seek: clear, simple, and user-friendly experiences. Tufte's redesign failed to recognise the unique grain of mobile design, which prioritises ease of use, readability, and focused information delivery.

**Striking the Balance**

The challenges and missteps in the field of data visualisation highlight the importance of understanding and working with the grain of the medium. It's not enough to simply present data in a visual form; designers must recognise the inherent tendencies and capacities of data visualisation as a unique form of communication.



Good data visualisation is not just about aesthetics; it's about conveying meaning, fostering understanding, and engaging the audience. It requires a careful balance of creativity and discipline, innovation and clarity, form and function.

Poorly designed visualisations that go against the grain serve as a cautionary tale, reminding us that adherence to fundamental principles and respect for the medium's grain is essential. It's about recognising the unique characteristics of data visualisation and using them to enhance rather than hinder communication.

**And so...**

In the ever-evolving field of data visualisation, the concept of working with or against the grain remains a guiding principle. From Tufte's pioneering vision to contemporary explorations and missteps, the journey of data visualisation offers valuable lessons in understanding the medium's unique grain.

Whether it's games like Minecraft or visual novels, or the complex world of data visualisation, recognising and embracing the grain leads to resonant and effective experiences. Conversely, going against the grain without thoughtful consideration can lead to dissonance and confusion. It's a concept that transcends disciplines, offering insights into how we can create more meaningful and engaging experiences across various platforms and formats. The challenge lies in finding that harmony between innovation and accessibility, where the technology and design enhance the narrative, not overwhelm it.

### The Grain of Text

The concept of working with the grain of a medium has been a guiding principle in various artistic and communicative endeavours. It reflects an alignment with the innate tendencies and capacities of a given medium, allowing creators to craft resonant and effective experiences. However, innovation and exploration often require stepping beyond established boundaries, breaking traditional moulds, and forging new paths. This adventurous spirit of exploration can lead to groundbreaking works that redefine our understanding of the medium itself.

**Breaking the Mould: "House of Leaves"**

An exemplary case of breaking outside the bounds of traditional artistic forms is Mark Z. Danielewski's novel "House of Leaves." Unlike the vast majority of books that can be easily transformed into ePubs or other digital formats, "House of Leaves" defies simple categorisation. It plays with visual design, page numbers, colours, and special codes, making it closer to an artistic artefact than a simple book.

The novel's complex layout and multifaceted narrative structure are integral to the reading experience, and they cannot be replicated in standard digital formats. Footnotes lead to appendices, mirrored text demands physical interaction, and different fonts and colours signify various layers of the story. This design goes against the grain of traditional book publishing, turning the physical book into a part of the narrative itself.

This deliberate choice to defy the conventional grain of book design has led to a unique and immersive reading experience, one that challenges readers' expectations and engages them on a deeper level. "House of Leaves" is not just a novel; it is a literary labyrinth that invites exploration, reflection, and active participation.

**Adapting to the Environment: "How Music Works"**

In his book "How Music Works," David Byrne explores how different kinds of music are impacted by the environment. He illustrates how musical compositions have evolved to reflect the characteristics of the spaces in which they are performed. From grand concert halls to intimate chambers, from boomboxes to headphones, music has adapted to resonate with the grain of the listening experience.

Byrne's insights reveal how understanding and aligning with the grain of the environment can lead to powerful and harmonious musical expressions. The art is not only in crafting the song but also in understanding the "concert hall" it will be played in.

**Nicky Case:**

Nicky Case’s work epitomizes the power of interactive storytelling. Through projects like "Loopy", Case has demonstrated how complex systems and ideas can be conveyed through playful, interactive models. Loopy, for instance, allows users to create and play with dynamic systems, making the abstract concepts of feedback loops and systemic behaviors accessible and understandable. Nicky Case’s creations are not just about passive consumption of information, but about fostering a deeper understanding through interaction and exploration. This approach breaks down the barriers of complexity, making learning a fun and engaging endeavor.

**Integration of Nicky Case's Work into Augmented Text**

Nicky Case's explorables, like "Parable of the Polygons" and "Loopy," embody the essence of augmented text by transforming static narratives into interactive experiences. These explorables are not merely embedded media; they are synergistic with the text, enhancing and expanding upon the written word without overshadowing it. This integration aligns perfectly with the goal of augmented text, which seeks to create a seamless blend of textual and interactive elements. By incorporating these explorables into the narrative, they serve as a bridge between traditional text and modern multimedia, creating a richer, more engaging reader experience.

Case’s work is exemplary in demonstrating the power of interactive storytelling. "Parable of the Polygons" is particularly relevant, using simple shapes and movements to illuminate complex social issues such as segregation and diversity. This interactive model allows users to engage with the content at a deeper level, manipulating variables and witnessing the immediate consequences of their actions. It's a poignant example of how augmented text can elevate understanding through participation.

Similarly, "Loopy" invites users to create and manipulate systems, learning through doing. It's a tool that encourages exploration and experimentation, key aspects of learning that are often undervalued in traditional text. By pulling these examples into the pattern library, your thesis not only acknowledges their value but also provides a framework for others to build upon.

As augmented text seeks to make information more accessible and engaging, Case's explorables serve as a beacon, showing how complex concepts can be distilled into interactive, understandable formats. The challenge lies in analysing these works to extract underlying principles that can be applied broadly to augmented text. It's about finding the balance between the illustrative power of interactivity and the clarity and brevity of the text. Case’s explorables do not replace the text; they enhance it, providing a model for augmented text that is both informative and captivating.

By incorporating these explorables into your thesis, you are not only acknowledging the work of a pioneer in interactive storytelling but also laying the groundwork for future explorations into augmented text. It's a testament to the power of interactivity as a complement to traditional writing, and a step towards a more dynamic, engaging form of communication.

Nicky Case's work is indispensable for the exploration of augmented text. These interactive narratives are more than mere examples; they are the embodiment of the potential that augmented text holds. They show how text can evolve beyond the page, becoming a dynamic tool for education, understanding, and engagement. By integrating these works into your thesis, you highlight the future possibilities of text and set a standard for others to follow.

**Google's interactive explorables**

The exploration of Google's interactive explorables presents an opportunity to observe how a tech giant interprets and applies the concept of augmented text. Their explorables page is a showcase of how interactive elements can be seamlessly integrated with textual information to enhance the user's understanding and engagement. This section will delve into specific examples from Google's repository that embody the principles of augmented text and how they can be applied to educational and informational content.

Google's approach to machine learning visualization is particularly noteworthy. By allowing users to adjust data points and instantly see the algorithm’s response, these explorables simplify the complexities of AI, making them approachable for non-experts. The immediate feedback provided by these tools exemplifies how augmented text can transform the reader's role from passive recipient to active participant.

Another feature worth highlighting is the "scroll through time" function, which offers a dynamic means to visualize change and development. This interactive timeline could serve as a model for illustrating the evolution of communication technologies in your thesis, offering readers a vivid understanding of historical transformations.

These examples of Google's explorables could serve as prototypes for augmented text within the thesis, illustrating the potential of interactive elements to enrich educational narratives. By discussing these tools, the thesis can demonstrate the practical applications of augmented text in simplifying and elucidating complex concepts. This analysis will also provide insights into the design principles that make these explorables effective, such as their intuitive interfaces and the balance between interactivity and informational content.

Through the inclusion of Google's explorables, your thesis can present a compelling argument for the integration of interactive media into traditional text, suggesting a future where digital communication is not only informative but also engaging and interactive. The section will conclude with a critical reflection on how these examples can inform the development of a pattern library for augmented text, which other researchers and practitioners can reference and expand upon.

**Incorporating Bartosz Ciechanowski's Work into Augmented Text**

The archives of Bartosz Ciechanowski provide a vast resource of interactive articles that exemplify the principles of augmented text. His approach to explaining complex topics through interactive graphics and intuitive explanations sets a benchmark for what augmented text can achieve. This section will explore how his work can be dissected to inform and inspire the pattern library of augmented text within the thesis.

Ciechanowski's articles, such as those elucidating the mechanics of cameras or the intricacies of internal combustion engines, go beyond mere illustration; they invite readers to interact with the concepts being discussed. This interactivity transforms the reader's experience from static absorption to dynamic exploration, a key characteristic of augmented text. By manipulating the elements within the articles, readers gain a hands-on understanding, which can be particularly effective for educational purposes.

The relevance of these articles to the thesis lies in their ability to demystify complex subjects, making them accessible to a broader audience. This is achieved not through oversimplification but through the power of interactive visualizations that work in concert with the written content. Each article presents an opportunity to analyze how text and interactive elements can be blended to create an enhanced reading experience.

As the thesis advocates for augmented text as a means of responsive communication, Ciechanowski's work can serve as a case study for implementing such principles effectively. It demonstrates how augmented text can provide clarity and insight into topics that might otherwise be impenetrable to those without specialized knowledge. The integration of these examples into the thesis will not only support the argument for augmented text but will also provide a practical framework for its application.

This exploration will culminate in a discussion of the design and educational philosophies underpinning Ciechanowski's work. The insights gleaned from this analysis will contribute to the development of a set of guidelines for creating augmented text, ensuring that such text is not only informative but also engaging and capable of fostering a deeper level of understanding.

By examining the archives of Ciechanowski, the thesis will bridge the gap between theoretical exploration and practical application, illustrating how augmented text can be used to create powerful and educational narratives. The section will underscore the importance of such work in the evolution of digital communication, positioning it as an integral component of the pattern library that others can draw upon for their own explorations of augmented text.

**"Homestuck": A Multi-Modal Marvel**

"Homestuck," created by Andrew Hussie, is a webcomic that delights in transcending traditional boundaries and defying categorisation. It is a unique blend of illustration, text, interactive games, and videos, creating a multi-modal experience that engages readers on multiple levels. The narrative is not confined to static images and words on a page; it spills into interactive Flash games, YouTube videos, and even physical merchandise. Hussie's creation doesn't just adhere to the grain of conventional storytelling but revels in exploring the myriad possibilities of digital media. This makes "Homestuck" not merely a webcomic but an expansive narrative universe that invites active participation and exploration.

**Bartosz Ciechanowski:**

The work of Bartosz Ciechanowski, colloquially known as "that bike guy" due to his detailed exploration of a bicycle's mechanics, is a brilliant example of marrying detailed technical explanations with interactive visualizations. Through his online archives, Ciechanowski delves into complex mechanisms and ideas, elucidating them with interactive 3D models. His approach invites readers to manipulate models, peeking under the hood of complex systems to understand their underlying principles. It’s a journey of discovery that turns every exploration into a rich learning experience, making even the most intricate concepts accessible to the curious minds.

**Web Alternate Reality Games (ARGs)**

The concept of web Alternate Reality Games (ARGs) further expands on this idea of multi-modal storytelling. ARGs blur the lines between fiction and reality, offering immersive experiences that extend beyond traditional media. Players interact with the game through various channels such as websites, social media, phone calls, and real-world events. Clues are dropped everywhere, and players must actively engage with the content, often collaborating with others, to unravel the story. The game is not confined to a single platform or format; it permeates the player's reality, turning the entire world into a playground.

**"LOST": Transmedia Storytelling**

The popular TV show "LOST" explored this space of transmedia storytelling by creating an ARG that accompanied the series. Beyond the television screen, "LOST" fans could delve into websites, fake commercials, and other media that expanded the show's universe. These additional layers of content provided deeper insights into the characters and mysteries of the show, allowing fans to actively participate in the narrative. This approach went against the grain of traditional television watching, turning passive viewers into active participants in a broader storytelling experience.

There's a whole community of people doing all sorts of productivity tricks. I need to explain all the things I'm _not_ talking about:

- Not plugins
- Not apps
- Not special syntax/tricks
- Not games or large applets
- Not simple hypertext links

I am talking about:

- Improved reading experiences enabled by small improvements to the reading experience

**The New Horizon:**\`

The initiatives by Google, Nicky Case, Bartosz Ciechanowski, and the broader movement towards Explorable Explanations and Multiverses herald a new era of communication and education. They challenge the status quo, inviting us to reimagine how we interact with information and ideas. It's a shift from static to dynamic, from passive to active, and from siloed to interconnected. As we step into this new horizon, the potential for creating more engaging, insightful, and impactful learning experiences is boundless. These innovations are not just a glimpse into the future of education and communication; they are a call to action for creators, educators, and learners to embrace the interactive, exploratory nature of the digital realm.


**Tying It All Together**

Both "Homestuck" and the ARG elements of "LOST" represent a new frontier in storytelling, one that embraces the interconnectedness and flexibility of modern media. They demonstrate that the grain of storytelling is not fixed or rigid but can be shaped, stretched, and reimagined to create rich and engaging experiences. By weaving together various media and allowing readers or viewers to actively engage with the content, creators can build immersive worlds that transcend the limitations of traditional formats. This multi-modal approach to storytelling is not just an innovation; it's a celebration of the endless possibilities of artistic expression in the digital age. Whether through the sprawling narrative of "Homestuck" or the layered mystery of "LOST," these works challenge us to rethink what storytelling can be and invite us to participate in shaping its future.

### Limitations

When Steve Jobs first saw a demo of the Segway scooter, he was misquoted as saying “someday they’ll build cities around this.” The actual quote wasn’t nearly as positive. He was dismissively saying “you’re asking cities to redesign themselves around this.” His point was that products need to coexist within the environment they find themselves in, not arrogantly believe the world will reorient itself to accept the product. The same is true with augmented text. Blogging software and professional-grade content management systems have a certain pattern: type words, add some multimedia to them, and publish. None of the ideas outlined in this paper would work with existing software, and the average CMS or blog user does not have the skills to write the software themselves. So what can we do?
