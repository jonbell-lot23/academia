### Abstract
I'll start with a statement that unpacks how responsive design has evolved beyond just adapting to different screen sizes. My core topic will be the exploration of how software can enhance learning comprehension and cater to a diverse range of learner needs.

### A survey of multimedia in the current day

Multimedia digital experiences have reached a comfortable and reliable steady-state. Most things are described in text, and sometimes audio visual components such as images, video, and audio are used beside them.

(Refer to The Grain of the Web) But as described in Grain of the Web, effective communication with text and media requires using the right tool for the job. A well-argued essay wouldn’t work as well as a series of images. A comic wouldn’t work as well described orally. A painting wasn’t meant to be a video. There is a “grain” to each media type that guides authors towards how to best use them, and if you go against the grain, they are less effective.

But as versatile and effective as text, video, images, and audio can be, new experiences can emerge when they’re combined together to make new art forms. The most mainstream example of this are video games. They combine audio, visual, and text components together into an overall experience that far exceeds reading text with embedded media beside them. In a word, the difference between the two is interactivity. Standard articles are static and lacking interactivity, whereas games focus their efforts on being interactive, or even immersive. They excel at different forms of communication, but are worse at others. For example, you wouldn’t want to read the novel War and Peace inside Minecraft. But you can’t experience anything like Minecraft in a song.

Simulations live between full-fledged games and traditional written content. Simulations live between full-fledged games and traditional written content. They provide a bridge between the static and the interactive, allowing users to manipulate variables and observe the outcomes. This makes simulations particularly effective for demonstrating complex systems or processes that would be difficult to explain with text or images alone. For example, in the context of climate science, a simulation could allow users to increase or decrease greenhouse gas emissions and observe the effects on global temperature, sea level, and more. The interactivity of simulations supports active learning, as users can explore the system or process at their own pace, experimenting with different scenarios and seeing the results. This helps users to understand not just what happens, but why it happens, deepening their understanding and knowledge retention.

Bret Victor identified this spectrum of communication and coined the term “Explorable Explanations” to describe written content that uses interactive components to communicate concepts more effectively. 

### Exploring Explorable Explanations

Explorable Explanations use interactivity to enhance the reader's understanding of complex ideas. They combine the benefits of text, images, and interactive elements to create an immersive learning experience. Instead of simply reading about a concept, users can manipulate it directly, exploring different facets and potential outcomes at their own pace.

For instance, an Explorable Explanation about the spread of diseases might allow users to modify variables like population density or vaccination rates, then observe the effect on disease spread. These manipulations help the readers visualise and internalise the concept more effectively. Importantly, Explorable Explanations aren't just more engaging—they're more effective. (NOT PROVEN, SOURCE NEEDED) By directly involving users in the learning process, they promote a deeper, more durable understanding of complex topics.

### Explorable Explanations are overly broad
- I'll begin with a brief history of the term "Explorable Explanations," which was coined by Bret Victor. I will define this term, emphasizing its key feature of combining text with interactive elements. Several renowned examples of explorable explanations such as "Parable of the Polygons" and others will be discussed, where I will provide a brief description of each and their unique aspects. I will draw parallels between explorable explanations and educational software, bringing out their similarities and differences.
- I'll address their overlap with simulations, discussing where and how these two concepts intersect.
- To conclude this section, I'll question the necessity of a strict definition for explorable explanations and propose an alternative approach: focusing on describing their individual components, interactions, features, and potential use cases.

### Introducing Responsive Communication
- I will start by identifying common components that make an online document successful. I'll list and briefly explain each: text, video, images, and embedded widgets.
- I will then introduce the concept of responsive communication, focusing on innovative components that can enhance learning comprehension. I'll list out examples, providing a brief overview of each.
- Examples library
	1. Image sliders: I will highlight how this feature can be used to compare and contrast different states of a situation (e.g., before and after disaster images).
	2. "Last read to here" indicator: I'll discuss its role in enhancing user experience by marking reading progress.
	3. Other
- I'll provide a summary of this section, emphasizing the importance of these components in creating engaging, effective online documents.
- I'll wrap up this section with my thoughts on the subject, including potential implications for future research and development.
