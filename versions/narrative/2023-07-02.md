### Notes to keep in mind since last time

* I’ve started laughingly calling this Allastair
* Click-to-expand app is a good thing to explore and expand on
* Right-click to translate is a good thing at the OS level, but providing other options are good. \<— I forget what this note meant
* William recommended [https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/biggestideas/][1] and said that could be a fantastic way to explain text
* Multi-touch versus scrolljacking — William has interesting points about this





### Abstract
I'll start with a statement that unpacks how responsive design has evolved beyond just adapting to different screen sizes. My core topic will be the exploration of how software can enhance learning comprehension and cater to a diverse range of learner needs.

Summary so far:

* The written word was a big innovation
* Now it’s networked and we have multimedia
* But between multimedia and games, there’s this interesting space
* Here are three important works: explorable explanations, snowfall, the web’s grain
* Explorable explanations is about making text into a place to learn
* Then snowfall showed this off and won a pulitzer
* It blended everything together in an important way
* Tangible feature #1: elements reacted to your scroll position
* Tangible features #2-#4: interactivity, layout, and animation






### A survey of multimedia in the current day

Multimedia digital experiences have reached a comfortable and reliable steady-state. Most things are described in text, and sometimes audio visual components such as images, video, and audio are used beside them.

(Refer to The Grain of the Web) But as described in Grain of the Web, effective communication with text and media requires using the right tool for the job. A well-argued essay wouldn’t work as well as a series of images. A comic wouldn’t work as well described orally. A painting wasn’t meant to be a video. There is a “grain” to each media type that guides authors towards how to best use them, and if you go against the grain, they are less effective.

But as versatile and effective as text, video, images, and audio can be, new experiences can emerge when they’re combined together to make new art forms. The most mainstream example of this are video games. They combine audio, visual, and text components together into an overall experience that far exceeds reading text with embedded media beside them. In a word, the difference between the two is interactivity. Standard articles are static and lacking interactivity, whereas games focus their efforts on being interactive, or even immersive. They excel at different forms of communication, but are worse at others. For example, you wouldn’t want to read the novel War and Peace inside Minecraft. But you can’t experience anything like Minecraft in a song.

Simulations live between full-fledged games and traditional written content. Simulations live between full-fledged games and traditional written content. They provide a bridge between the static and the interactive, allowing users to manipulate variables and observe the outcomes. This makes simulations particularly effective for demonstrating complex systems or processes that would be difficult to explain with text or images alone. For example, in the context of climate science, a simulation could allow users to increase or decrease greenhouse gas emissions and observe the effects on global temperature, sea level, and more. The interactivity of simulations supports active learning, as users can explore the system or process at their own pace, experimenting with different scenarios and seeing the results. This helps users to understand not just what happens, but why it happens, deepening their understanding and knowledge retention.

Bret Victor identified this spectrum of communication and coined the term “Explorable Explanations” to describe written content that uses interactive components to communicate concepts more effectively. 

### Exploring Explorable Explanations

Explorable Explanations use interactivity to enhance the reader's understanding of complex ideas. They combine the benefits of text, images, and interactive elements to create an immersive learning experience. Instead of simply reading about a concept, users can manipulate it directly, exploring different facets and potential outcomes at their own pace.

For instance, an Explorable Explanation about the spread of diseases might allow users to modify variables like population density or vaccination rates, then observe the effect on disease spread. These manipulations help the readers visualise and internalise the concept more effectively. Importantly, Explorable Explanations aren't just more engaging—they're more effective. (NOT PROVEN, SOURCE NEEDED) By directly involving users in the learning process, they promote a deeper, more durable understanding of complex topics.

When The New York Times released the "Snow Fall" interactive feature in 2012, it sparked waves of excitement within the digital media industry. This unprecedented piece of multimedia storytelling, a long-form article punctuated by interactive graphics, videos, and immersive animations, seemed to herald the dawn of a new era for online media. Snowfall was a trailblazer, representing a powerful blend of traditional journalistic storytelling and interactive elements, promising an engaging and immersive reader experience.

The innovative approach of Snowfall was met with critical acclaim, winning the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing. Its influence was quickly seen in the proliferation of 'Snowfall-like' features across the digital media landscape, as news outlets and other media organisations sought to emulate its success. The term 'Snowfall' even became a verb within the industry, describing the process of creating rich, multimedia experiences within a long-form article.

However, the initial enthusiasm surrounding Snowfall was soon tempered by the realisation of its inherent challenges. Despite its apparent success, the production of Snowfall was a costly endeavour, both in terms of time and resources. It required a team of skilled developers and designers working intensively over several months to bring the project to fruition. This high level of investment was not a feasible model for most media outlets, particularly for those with smaller budgets or shorter timelines.

Furthermore, the feature was not without technical issues. Users reported numerous bugs, with interactive elements often failing to load properly or behaving inconsistently across different devices and browsers. The high-quality multimedia content, while visually impressive, was also demanding on system resources, leading to slow load times and performance issues for users with less powerful computers or slower internet connections.

These shortcomings highlighted a crucial paradox at the heart of the Snowfall experience. While it demonstrated the immense potential of interactive media and storytelling, it also underscored the technical and economic hurdles that must be overcome to make such experiences accessible and enjoyable for all users. This points towards the need for more scalable and efficient approaches to producing interactive content, as well as better optimisation strategies to ensure smooth performance across a range of devices and connection speeds.

### Explorable Explanations are overly broad
- I'll begin with a brief history of the term "Explorable Explanations," which was coined by Bret Victor. I will define this term, emphasizing its key feature of combining text with interactive elements. Several renowned examples of explorable explanations such as "Parable of the Polygons" and others will be discussed, where I will provide a brief description of each and their unique aspects. I will draw parallels between explorable explanations and educational software, bringing out their similarities and differences.
- I'll address their overlap with simulations, discussing where and how these two concepts intersect.
- To conclude this section, I'll question the necessity of a strict definition for explorable explanations and propose an alternative approach: focusing on describing their individual components, interactions, features, and potential use cases.

### Introducing Responsive Communication
- I will start by identifying common components that make an online document successful. I'll list and briefly explain each: text, video, images, and embedded widgets.
- I will then introduce the concept of responsive communication, focusing on innovative components that can enhance learning comprehension. I'll list out examples, providing a brief overview of each.
- Examples library
	- (see below)
- I'll provide a summary of this section, emphasizing the importance of these components in creating engaging, effective online documents.
- I'll wrap up this section with my thoughts on the subject, including potential implications for future research and development.
