# Augmented Text

# Abstract

The history of human communication started with speech, evolved to include written history, and in modern times added hyperlinks. Since then, the experience of reading text hasn't seen much improvement. In this paper, I’ll survey the state of multimedia today and explain why augmented text addresses scenarios and needs that are unaddressable with traditional multimedia alone.

# Introduction: Envisioning the Evolution of Communication

<DancingAboutArchitecture />

Let's ponder this for a moment—the little 'Explain Like I'm Five' feature you just witnessed is a tiny marvel that traditional books can't replicate. In a conventional book, you might awkwardly flip back and forth between an advanced explanation and a simplified one, but it's clunky and doesn't really flow. And what if we want to adapt the text even further? Imagine trying to accommodate someone with dyslexia by altering the font, shielding a reader from content they might find distressing, or providing detailed teaching materials for teaching complex concepts like Shakespeare. These concepts far exceed the technological abilities of standard books.

If we agree that the act of reading can be improved, we might swing to the other end of the spectrum and make everything into standalone apps or websites. While those solutions may provide more context and assistance, they would be frustrating. No one wants to download a new app for every book they read. Even if these apps came packed with every conceivable feature, the sheer bulk of information in the reading experience would make them unweidly, adding intolerable weight to what should be a simple act of reading.

At its heart, augmented text is about preserving the simplicity and joy of reading while carefully and discreetly weaving in layers of interactivity. These digital features are nimble, unobtrusive, and responsive to our individual needs, whether it's toggling between an advanced and simplified explanation with a simple click or changing the visual presentation for accessibility. They're there when you need them, invisible when you don't, enhancing our understanding without overshadowing the text itself. Thus the principles of **seamless blending** and **concise enhancement**.

Think of augmented text as a book that responds to each user's individual needs. It's the bridge between the static page and the dynamic world of digital possibilities. A canvas where text is no longer just ink on paper but a helpful entity that adapts to the unique needs of its reader. It's an environment where the barriers to understanding are lowered, not by replacing the book, but by enhancing it in ways that were once the exclusive domain of science fiction.

And that's what this paper will explore—how augmented text takes the timeless act of reading and imbues it with the adaptability of the digital age. Just as a chameleon changes its colours to suit its environment, augmented text reshapes itself to suit the reader's needs. It's reading, reimagined for a world where the written word is no longer static, but dynamic; not fixed, but fluid; not one-size-fits-all, but personalised. It's a quiet revolution, a gentle augmentation of the reading experience that promises to make it richer, more accessible, and infinitely more adaptable. It's an step forward that is long overdue.

### Augmented Text's core principles

**1. Seamless Blending:** Augmented text should integrate naturally and unobtrusively into the narrative, merging interactive elements into the reading experience in a way that feels intuitive and harmonious.

**2. Concise Enhancement:** Augmented text is intended to complement, not overpower, the written word. It aims to enrich the narrative with targeted, succinct additions, adding depth while maintaining the integrity and fluency of the text.

These principles will serve as our benchmarks as we examine augmented text in various contexts, such as gaming and data visualization. We will assess how well these innovations adhere to the ideals of seamless blending and concise enhancement in enhancing written communication.

Before we dive into the specifics of augmented text and its potential to transform our reading experiences, it's important to understand the context from which it arises. Let's pause to survey the landscape of human communication that stretches behind us, from the oral traditions of our distant ancestors to the written word's evolution. This retrospective will lay the groundwork for appreciating augmented text as not just a novelty, but as the next logical step in the journey of storytelling and information sharing. So let's begin by tracing the lineage of our communicative practices, setting the stage for the innovations that augmented text represents.

### In the beginning, there were words

The essence of storytelling has never changed. From ancient tales shared around the fire to today's digital narratives, the objective has always been to inform, entertain, persuade, and connect on as wide a scale as possible. Just as ancient storytellers might have held their listeners spellbound with memorable narratives around a campfire, so do modern podcasts, TED Talks, and Netflix shows. Cuneiform, the printing press, and the internet are extraordinarily different technologies and implementations yet are aiming towards the same noble goal: reaching as many people as possible to communicate as effectively as possible.

There are parallels between old and new, because storytelling is core to the human experience. While tools and technologies evolve, the fundamental human need for communication remains. Augmented text, with its interactive and multimedia capabilities, is simply the latest iteration in this continuum. It takes the essence of what has always been important in communication — clarity, impact, engagement, and accessibility — and builds upon it with the benefits afforded by modern technology that we're missing out on by not re-evaluating the experience of reading and improving it to keep pace with how people read in modern contexts.

By weaving this story arc through this research, we'll show that augmented text is not an faddish outlier in the history of communication but the next step of a natural progression. It embodies the same principles that have driven the development of communication methods for millennia, now accelerated by digital interactivity and the global reach of the internet. This perspective will serve to situate augmented text within a broader historical context, demonstrating its relevance and potential as the next step in the ongoing journey of human expression. We'll also illustrate why a next step is necessary, and why multimedia has plateaued since the invention of the hyperlink.

**Let's get specific**

When our ancient ancestors narrated stories around the fire, they were not only preserving their heritage but also embedding the roots of language as we understand it today. This fundamental drive for communication echoes Noam Chomsky's influential linguistic theories. Chomsky (1957) introduced the groundbreaking concept of a "universal grammar," proposing that certain aspects of linguistic structure are innate to the human mind and thus universally present in all languages. This perspective, which he further developed in his later works (Chomsky, 1965), implies that the capacity for language is biologically hardwired rather than acquired. Chomsky's theories, as expounded in his subsequent works (Chomsky, 2005), suggest that this innate language facility has played a critical role in human evolution, shaping our ability to communicate complex ideas and narratives. The transition from oral tradition to written language, a pivotal moment in the history of human communication, can be viewed through the lens of Chomsky's linguistic framework. Lewandowska-Tomaszczyk (2016) further expounded on the evolution and impact of Chomsky's generative grammar, underscoring its significance in the progression from oral storytelling to the written word. These theoretical insights provide a deeper understanding of the intrinsic nature of language and its role in human civilisation.

Around 3400 BC, Sumerian scribes in Mesopotamia laid the groundwork for the first known form of written communication, called cuneiform. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform) This intricate system of wedge-shaped marks pressed into clay tablets allowed the recording of inventories, laws, and narratives, marking a significant improvement around how humankind preserved and disseminated knowledge. This allowed information to outlive its author and be shared with audiences for the first time. The impact of this technology cannot be overstated; it's easily on par with the invention of the wheel and fire, and was the precursor, however humbly, to the contemporary reading experience we experience today.

Tablets were a good start, but they were hardly portable. This lead to the invention of paper by the Chinese around the 1st century AD. Then the printing press, invented by Johannes Gutenberg in 15th century Europe, took the revolution a step further by making the process easier and widely available. Knowledge was no longer the exclusive domain of the affluent and the clergy; it was accessible to anyone who could read. (Kross et al., 2021) Like cuneiform and paper before it, this technology permanently changed the way humanity communicated, and the resulting impact, again, cannot be overstated. As Albertin et al. (2018) explore, the forces unleashed when information became more portable weren't all good or all bad. They simply accelerated many good and bad aspects of society, an insight that seems familiar to us today with all the promise and peril of the modern internet.

The evolution from spoken word to written, then from expensive to cheap, set up the desktop and internet revolutions of the late 20th century, followed by the explosion of smartphone usage, which made communication as cheap and plentiful as it’s ever been. Today, the combination of the internet and mobile means we've never had more content, in reach of as many people (both in absolute terms and per capita), being produced by more people. Yet the technology we're using to communicate multimedia concepts has stayed surprisingly static for the last 50 years. With the exception of the popularisation of the hyperlink in the 1990s, there has been very little technological innovation that has changed the way we consume the written word.

We used to speak around campfires, whereas now we record podcasts, shoot Instagram stories, and record video chats. But at their heart, it's all just verbal communication. We used to write stories, first on caves, then on tablets, then on paper. Now we've added websites, status updates, ebooks, and group texts, but and their heart, they're all just textual communication. You can tell the same stories about music and video; music has always been music, even as the technology powering them changes and evolves. Movies have always been movies, whether black and white, full colour, 3d, or VR. And the consumption experiences for all have stayed largely the same as well. We still watch movies and plays in theatres, we still listen to music on our own or as part of a group concert. We still watch people tell stories, whether around a campfire, on YouTube, or at a stand-up comedy show. The more things change, the more they stay the same.

"By perceiving modern digital formats like the Kindle, YouTube videos, or online news stories as mere digital versions of their traditional counterparts, we risk missing opportunities for more impactful communication. This oversight is akin to the initial limitations of early websites and TV shows, which merely replicated existing physical and broadcast formats. Neil Postman, in his seminal work 'Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business,' echoes this concern, critiquing the tendency to view new media forms as mere extensions of the old without acknowledging their unique characteristics and implications (Citation: Postman, 1985). He warns against the uncritical acceptance of these forms, urging a more nuanced examination of how they shape communication and discourse. This phenomenon highlights the importance of seamlessly blending new technologies with traditional media. Just as television evolved from the simplicity of 'I Love Lucy' to the complexity of 'Game of Thrones,' our understanding and use of digital media must also progress. While the essence of storytelling remains constant, the methods of delivery should be enhanced, aiming for both conciseness and seamless integration with emerging technologies."

The realm of interactive media and multimedia, while often static in its approach, contrasts sharply with the dynamic nature of games, which have consistently been a fertile ground for interactive innovations. This distinction is particularly evident in the work of Barr, who explores the unique aspects of human-computer interaction within video games. In his research, Barr (Citation: 2008) emphasises that unlike traditional software, video games are played rather than used, necessitating a different approach to understanding interaction—one that considers 'play' as a central component. His analysis of how players' beliefs and values about preferable conduct influence their interaction with games sheds light on the multi-layered complexity of gaming as a form of human-computer interaction. This perspective is crucial for comprehending the interactive depth of games and their potential for innovation in the broader multimedia landscape, and why it far exceeds the narrow scope of what a reading experience demands.

This raises some crucial questions: Can elements from gaming be integrated seamlessly with traditional communication forms in a way that enhances rather than complicates the simple act of reading and the plain goal of communicating clearly? Does "play" automatically cause text to move from the realm of reading and into something more cognitively heavy, and therefore less effective as text? The answers are nuanced, and this exploration will delve into how interactive elements can be incorporated concisely and seamlessly into augmented text. Our aim is to explore how these interactive components can enrich the storytelling experience without overwhelming the core message, and therefore adhering to the principles of augmented text.

# The Limitations of Contemporary Multimedia

### A Failure of Imagination

To understand how contemporary multimedia is created, imagine writing a blog post in a large media organisation. What forms of media would be in your multimedia toolkit?

- Text input
- Links
- Images
- Video

And that's it. If you want to add something as simple as a gallery or slideshow of photos, you require a special widget or component. In most cases, this request would require special knowledge from someone with the right experience to offer it. This is reminiscent of how early versions of the bible were only decipherable by highly educated people in the church, requiring average people to ask for help. (Citation: Bible Gateway, n.d.) What if you want to show a comparison between two images, perhaps to show a before and after image of the effects of hurricane? Again, you'd be out of luck without someone coding the component for you. Or what if you wanted to provide some light interactivity to help explain a complex concept? Not possible unless you can explain it in text, images, or maybe a video. It's hard to argue that "text, sometimes with an image embedded in it," really counts as interactive multimedia. It's pretty close to reading a magazine or newspaper from 100 years ago, the only difference being that it's delivered over the internet, to a screen, with hyperlinks, and sometimes with an embedded video.

On the other end of the interactive spectrum, we have video games, a media type categorisation so broad as to be meaningless. One could make the argument that the subject matter addressed by games is even more vast than the entire collected works of books in all of human recorded history. The difference is in interactivity. Romeo and Juliet is just another love story, but if you played Romeo and Juliet as a simulated experience, you could drive the story however you want. By definition, a book will have one ending. By definition, many games will be expected to have multiple endings, multiple paths to get there, and a sense of autonomy that makes each experience necessarily different from anyone else's experience. Citizen Kane is an epic movie about a legendary character. A single interactive product like World of Warcraft aims to provide multiple storylines just as epic and personalised as Citizen Kane to the more than 100 million people who have played it. In terms of sheer quantity, there's no contest which experience provides a wider range of experiences.

But quantity isn't the only metric. When you're reading a news article, you're not seeking a game of pinball. When you're playing Minecraft, you're not seeking to read a 300 page book of lore. As demonstrated in Grain of the Web (Citation: Chimero, 2015) and referred to frequently in this thesis, effective communication with text and media requires using the right tool for the job. Just as you wouldn't use a screwdriver to hammer a nail, or rely on interpretative dance to critique some architecture, an essay doesn't work as well as a series of images. A comic wouldn’t work as well described orally. A painting wasn’t meant to be a video. There is a “grain” to each media type that guides authors towards how to best use them, and if you go against the grain, they are less effective. The key to successful design and communication is to work within the space. I propose that multimedia artists have gotten complacent, where we have simple CMS systems for writing with text + images and overly complex game authoring environments for anything more complex than text. There's a vast space in between those extremes that warrants a closer look. To date, the closest word most people have used to describe this space is "simulation."

Simulations live between full-fledged games and traditional written content. They provide a bridge between the static and the interactive, allowing users to manipulate variables and observe the outcomes. This makes simulations particularly effective for demonstrating complex systems or processes that would be difficult to explain with text or images alone. For example, in the context of climate science, a simulation could allow users to increase or decrease greenhouse gas emissions and observe the effects on global temperature, sea level, and more. The interactivity of simulations supports active learning, as users can explore the system or process at their own pace, experimenting with different scenarios and seeing the results. This helps users to understand not just what happens, but why it happens, deepening their understanding and knowledge retention. This is not a new field, but it's one that's been poorly defined and advocated for for many years. The closest we've come in the popular imagination is when Bret Victor identified this spectrum of communication and coined the term “Explorable Explanations” to describe products that live in the middle of the two extremes: written content that uses interactive components to communicate concepts more effectively. (Citation: Victor, 2011) That's where we'll be focusing next.

### “Explorable Explanations” and “Active Essays”

Bret Victor introduced the concept of Explorable Explanations to offer a new way of presenting and interacting with text. The core idea is to transform text from mere information to be consumed into an "environment to think in." This was envisioned as an umbrella project with the goal of encouraging truly active reading. To make abstract concepts more concrete, Victor proposed the development of reactive documents that allow readers to manipulate authors' assumptions and see the consequences, explorable examples that make abstract concepts concrete, and contextual information that allows readers to learn related material just-in-time and cross-check the author's claims.

Victor's ideas, however, were not completely new. Computing pioneer Alan Kay had previously discussed the concept of active essays which blended computer-based simulations with explanatory text. (Citation: Kay, 2003) This was a part of his vision for transforming the computer into a new kind of medium for creative thought, combining the dynamic and interactive nature of the computer with the narrative and argumentative strength of the essay.

These ideas have led to a surge of explorations in the field. Notably, Nicky Case has been instrumental in bringing these ideas to life. One notable example is "Parable of the Polygons", a web-based interactive simulation game that visually demonstrates how small individual biases can lead to large collective biases, thus providing an explorable explanation of systemic societal biases. (Citation: Hart and Case, 2014)

By 2012, Explorable explanations were gaining momentum, as authors in education, journalism, and data science began to see the potential these interactive tools had for transforming their fields. Educators were recognising the value of engaging students in a more active role, where critical thinking was not just encouraged but required. Journalists, on platforms such as Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight, were starting to experiment with these tools, using them to elucidate complex datasets and statistical models, allowing their readers to interact with and digest intricate information through hands-on exploration.

Yet, despite these burgeoning explorations, there was a lingering challenge in defining what exactly constituted an explorable explanation. Was it distinct from a simulation, a game, or an interactive educational tool? The boundaries remained blurred. It was difficult to pinpoint a single instance that encapsulated the entire concept until "Snowfall" arrived and set a new benchmark. It was a traditional article, not an embedded video or interactive demo, but the careful and innovative touches of interactivity they added hit the collective imagination as something new and useful. And not just that, it won a Pulitzer.

### The Importance of Snowfall

When The New York Times released the "Snow Fall" interactive feature (Citation: Duenes & Kueneman, 2012), it sparked waves of excitement within the digital media industry. This unprecedented piece of multimedia storytelling, a long-form article punctuated by interactive graphics, videos, and immersive animations, seemed to herald the dawn of a new era for online media. Snowfall was a trailblazer, representing a powerful blend of traditional journalistic storytelling and interactive elements, promising an engaging and immersive reader experience.

The innovative approach of Snowfall was met with critical acclaim, winning the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing. Its influence was quickly seen in the proliferation of 'Snowfall-like' features across the digital media landscape, as news outlets and other media organisations sought to emulate its success. The term 'Snowfall' even became a verb within the industry, describing the process of creating rich, multimedia experiences within a long-form article.

However, the initial enthusiasm surrounding Snowfall was soon tempered. Despite the benefits of the new format, it was still hard to use, buggy, and complicated. The production of Snowfall was a costly endeavour, both in terms of time and resources. It required a team of skilled developers and designers working intensively over several months to bring the project to fruition. This high level of investment was not a feasible model for most media outlets, particularly for those with smaller budgets or shorter timelines.

Furthermore, the feature was not without technical issues. Users reported numerous bugs, with interactive elements often failing to load properly or behaving inconsistently across different devices and browsers. The high-quality multimedia content, while visually impressive, was also demanding on system resources, leading to slow load times and performance issues for users with less powerful computers or slower internet connections.

The conundrum posed by "Snowfall" is far from unique in the history of technological innovation. History is full of pioneering ideas that have stumbled at the crossroads of potential and practicality. Take, for example, the early days of virtual reality in the 1990s. As Durlach and Mavor noted in their 1995 work, these early VR systems often characterised by inelegant hardware, a nausea-inducing user experience, and prohibitive costs, making the technology not yet ripe for widespread adoption.

Similarly, consider the early generations of mass-produced electric cars, which emerged as a beacon of promise for a cleaner, more efficient future in personal transport. Initiated by major auto manufacturers in response to the evolving landscape of the 1970s and 1990s, these vehicles, including notable models like General Motors' EV1, embodied the potential for a significant shift in automotive technology. However, they were beset by substantial drawbacks. The quality of these early electric cars was often compromised by issues such as limited range, lengthy charging times, and a lack of necessary infrastructure. Furthermore, as Gandoman et al. (Citation: 2019) highlight, the reliability and safety of these early electric vehicles' components, including battery packs, power electronic converters, and electric motors, were significant concerns. Despite carrying the seeds of a greener future, these vehicles were emblematic of the challenges that pioneering technologies often face - showing a path forward, but not yet ready to meet the practical demands of the time (Citation: Team GridREV, 2011; Gandoman et al., 2019).

Both these examples underscore the fits and starts that any technology must suffer through before finding broad commercial success, if at all. Writer William Gibson has observed "the future is already here — it's just not very evenly distributed." Is this so? An average consumer, even a rich one, couldn't experience any kind of device we'd recognise as a smartphone in 1983, and the best technology in the world today can't reliably make nuclear fusion work. "But there were indeed prototype versions of smartphones as early as 1983 (Citation: History of mobile phones, n.d.) and prototypes of fusion power achieving significant breakthroughs in 2023 (Citation: Tollefson, 2023)." The question is not whether or not the future "exists" (a low bar if speculative fiction and forgotten research papers counts as "existing") but instead if the technology is good enough for mainstream commercialised appeal. The length of time between a product's invention to commercialisation, then from market formation, expansion, and eventually saturation, can stretch for a long time. For example, chatGPT only took two months to reach 100,000,000 users, but the concept of AI was first coined in 1956. OpenAI was founded in December 2015, GPT was built in 2018, GPT-3 arrived in 2020, and the chatGPT that became the fastest growing consumer product in human history wasn't released until November 2022. (Citation: UBS, 2023) Every step relied on the steps that came before it, but the impact to the rest of the world didn't come when the technology theoretically existed, but when normal people could benefit from it.

"Snowfall" was right on the cusp between being good enough to inspire and broken enough to frustrate. Its vision for a new storytelling paradigm was clear, but the tools and systems necessary for its realisation were not yet in place for broad acceptance. The challenge, then, as with all emerging technologies, was to close the gap between the vanguard of innovation and the trailing edge of accessibility. It was about finding scalable, efficient, and economically viable ways to deliver the rich potential of interactive media to all users, regardless of their technological or financial circumstances. The road from potential to ubiquity is rarely a straight line; it is a winding path marked by iteration, refinement, and the gradual democratisation of once-exclusive and experimental technologies.

### The Snowfall backlash (The Grain of the Web)

In 2015, three years post "Snowfall," Frank Chimero published "The Web's Grain," an insightful reflection on web design and digital interaction. (Citation: Chimero, 2015) Without directly mentioning "Snowfall," Chimero struck a chord with developers wrestling with similar issues. His concept of "grain" in media products, borrowed from the craft of woodworking, articulated a truth many sensed but hadn't named—it's the intrinsic nature of materials that should guide our creations.

Chimero's "grain" speaks to the inherent properties of any medium. Just as wood has a direction to its fibers that informs a carpenter's work, digital mediums have an inherent "grain" that should guide design. The most harmonious digital experiences, Chimero suggests, are those crafted in sync with the web’s flexible, interconnected nature, respecting its "edgelessness" or the absence of strict confines.

Snowfall, while innovative, arguably bucked against the web's grain. Its ambition outstripped its execution, becoming a resource-heavy behemoth that often stumbled across the varied landscape of devices and browsers. It lacked the fluidity and adaptability that Chimero identified as hallmarks of the web's true nature. This pioneering project was indeed a spectacle, but one that perhaps flew too close to the sun, revealing the delicate balance between innovation and the current technological reach. It underscored the necessity for digital creations to not only push boundaries but also to move in harmony with the ever-evolving digital ecosystem.

Chimero might argue that this approach ran counter to the web's inherent fluidity and adaptability. While the project harnessed some of the web's potential for rich multimedia storytelling, its complex design and performance issues revealed a misalignment with the web's grain.

Yet, despite these flaws, the concept behind Snowfall aligns with Chimero's vision of embracing the web's unique capacities. The New York Times's interactive feature represents an attempt to leverage the web's potential for creating immersive, interconnected experiences that transcend traditional linear storytelling. Even though its execution was not perfect, the ambition and innovation behind Snowfall signalled a step towards more engaging and interactive forms of online content.

Chimero’s essay urges us to step back from the precipice of overcomplicated, overly-ambitious design and to reconsider the fundamental properties of the web – a more versatile, flexible and inherently complex medium than any that have come before. This call for a return to simplicity, however, is not a call for stagnation or resistance against innovation. Rather, it is a challenge to embrace the medium in its fullness, harness its unique properties, and wield these attributes to push the boundaries of digital storytelling.

Seen through this lens, "Snowfall" isn’t so much a failed experiment, but an important milestone that stretched the conceptual limits of online communication. It unveiled a tantalising glimpse of the web’s potential while laying bare the challenges of aligning with the web’s unique grain. This experience showed us the value in creating digital narratives that are innovative, accessible, and engaging – narratives that ride with the web's grain rather than against it.

The promise of Snowfall, then, isn't in the specific form it took but rather the vision it represented – a vision of using the web's unique capacities for storytelling, learning, and understanding. It's about blending the strengths of the medium with content, not wedging content into unwieldy software experiences.

However, to translate this vision into practice, we need to focus on what makes online documents successful: text, video, images, and embedded widgets. These components are not just passive containers of information, but dynamic instruments of communication, each with its unique way of engaging users and conveying meaning.

In addition to these, we introduce the concept of responsive communication - an innovative approach that focuses on enhancing comprehension and interactivity. To truly harness the web's grain, we must design digital experiences that respond to users' actions and adapt to their needs. These can range from interactive diagrams that users can manipulate to gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter, to smart annotations that provide additional information on demand, to simulations that allow users to explore different scenarios and outcomes.

These components create a more holistic and immersive experience. They do not function as separate, disconnected pieces wedged into a page but as a cohesive whole. They become a part of the narrative, supplementing and enhancing the main text rather than distracting from it.

But, as we move towards embracing these new tools and approaches, we must not lose sight of the core of all communication: words. The fundamental purpose of any digital communication, no matter how visually stunning or interactively engaging, is to convey meaning through content.

Therefore, we propose creating a component library - a collection of versatile, reusable components that seamlessly integrate into the narrative flow, enhancing the storytelling and learning process. A tool like this allows us to avoid the pitfall of over-complication, keeping us grounded in our ultimate goal: to communicate effectively.

In essence, our journey from Snowfall, through The Web's Grain, and back to words represents a shift in our understanding and approach to digital storytelling. It's about recognising the unique grain of the web and using it to create more meaningful, effective, and engaging experiences. It's about finding that sweet spot between innovation and accessibility, where the technology enhances the narrative rather than overwhelming it.

### Innovating from Inspiration

Innovation within and beyond the grain is an exciting frontier in the exploration of text as a medium. Whether adhering to the grain or boldly defying it, creators have the opportunity to craft meaningful, engaging, and transformative experiences. From the artistic experimentation of "House of Leaves" to the multi-modal storytelling of "Homestuck," the adaptive evolution of music, the intricate puzzles of web ARGs, and the ongoing exploration of digital text, the journey is filled with potential.

It's about striking a balance between tradition and innovation, resonance and dissonance, familiarity and novelty. It's about recognising the grain, understanding its limitations, and pushing its boundaries. It's about building not just the song but also the concert hall, not just the words but also the world in which they live.

The challenge and opportunity lie in our willingness to explore, to question, to experiment, and to innovate. The grain of the medium is not a constraint but a starting point, a foundation upon which we can build, expand, and reimagine. The future of text is a canvas waiting to be painted, a story waiting to be told, a grain waiting to be explored. Whether it's a multi-layered digital comic, a groundbreaking television show, or a novel that defies conventional reading, the potential is vast, and the grain is ripe for exploration. So let's explore!

# With the Grain: Where Augmented Text Fits In the Multimedia Landscape

### Beyond Explorable Explanations

This research started with an Explorable Explanations focus because of the influence of pioneers like Alan Kay and Bret Victor. These innovative thinkers envisioned a new horizon for interactive media, one where the boundaries between user and content were not just blurred but actively redefined. The essence of Explorable Explanations lies in transforming static text into dynamic, interactive experiences, enabling readers to engage with content in ways that traditional mediums could never allow.

As I delved deeper into this field, I uncovered a multitude of research papers that attempted to chart this relatively unexplored territory. What became increasingly evident was the ambiguity surrounding the precise positioning of Explorable Explanations within the wider multimedia landscape. The concept seemed to float in a nebulous space overlapping various domains – part educational software, part game, and part standard embedded software. Each study seemed to pull this idea in a different direction, adding to the confusion about its definitive place in the world of interactive media.

Despite my admiration for Explorable Explanations and their potential to revolutionise how we interact with text, a critical realisation dawned on me. At their core, these interactive tools, no matter how sophisticated or engaging, are essentially widgets nestled within a textual flow. And herein lies a paradox. As these widgets strive to do more – to be more interactive, more engaging, more complex – they inadvertently begin to disrupt the very essence of what they are meant to enhance: the reading experience.

The primary goal of text, in its purest form, is to facilitate clear and effective communication. It is a medium that has evolved over millennia to convey thoughts, ideas, and information in a manner that is direct, efficient, and accessible. When we introduce elements that are too divergent – too 'explorable' – we risk detracting from this fundamental purpose. In their ambition to augment, these explanations can end up obfuscating, pulling the reader away from the narrative rather than drawing them deeper into it.

This is not to diminish the value or potential of Explorable Explanations. On the contrary, their promise is vast and largely untapped. But as with any tool, their effectiveness lies in how they are used. The key is to strike a balance – to embed these interactive elements in a way that complements rather than competes with the text. They must serve the narrative, not overshadow it.

The challenge, then, is to create Explorable Explanations that align with the 'grain' of the text. This means understanding the inherent rhythm and flow of written communication and designing interactions that harmonise with it. It's about finding that sweet spot where augmentation enhances comprehension and engagement without disrupting the narrative's natural cadence.

While Explorable Explanations represent a significant leap forward in the evolution of text-based communication, they must be integrated thoughtfully. They should be woven into the fabric of the text in a way that feels natural and intuitive, enhancing the reader's journey rather than diverting it. As we continue to explore the vast potential of augmented text, let us remember that the ultimate goal is not to reinvent the wheel but to make it roll smoother.

While Explorable Explanations, as discussed, primarily revolve around interactive widgets within textual narratives, Augmented Text takes a broader approach. It encompasses not just the integration of interactive elements but also the enhancement of the text itself through various digital means. Unlike Explorable Explanations, which sometimes risk overwhelming the core text, Augmented Text strives for a more harmonious balance. It aligns with the grain of traditional reading by subtly infusing digital enhancements that enrich, rather than disrupt, the reading experience. This seamless integration respects the natural flow of reading while offering depth and interactivity that traditional text lacks.

### The Grain of Games

In the world of digital games, the concept of "grain" can also be applied to understand the inherent nature and purpose of different game genres. Just as Frank Chimero described the grain of the web, games have an innate tendency and purpose that guide their design and player experience. When a game's design aligns with its grain, it creates a cohesive and immersive experience. Conversely, going against the grain can lead to disjointed and unsettling gameplay.

**Minecraft: A Sandbox with Limits**

Take the example of Minecraft, a sandbox game that allows players an almost unlimited freedom to build, explore, and create within a pixelated world. Its grain lies in the open-ended nature of exploration and creativity. Players can construct vast cities, intricate machines, or even write simple texts within the game. However, this grain has its limits.

Imagine being tasked with reading an entire novel within Minecraft. Though technically possible, this would be a jarring experience that goes against the grain of the game. Minecraft's environment is not conducive to long-form reading. The blocky aesthetics, navigation mechanics, and interactive dynamics are not designed to provide a comfortable or engaging reading experience. The novel's presence in the game would feel unnatural and dissonant, as it conflicts with the inherent tendencies of the game to provide spatial and tactile exploration.

**Visual Novels: When Games Meet Literature**

Visual novels, on the other hand, provide a unique intersection of gaming and reading. They are designed to offer interactive storytelling experiences, where players make choices that guide the narrative. Here, the grain is a blend of reading and light interactivity, where the emphasis is on narrative immersion rather than complex gameplay mechanics.

Now, imagine if a visual novel suddenly transitioned into a fast-paced action game without warning. This shift would be jolting and might feel inappropriate within the context of the story. It would go against the grain of what a visual novel is meant to be. The player is prepared for a reading experience with decision-making, not an intense battle requiring rapid reflexes.

**Embracing the Grain**

The examples of Minecraft and visual novels illustrate that understanding the grain of a game is essential to creating a harmonious player experience. When developers recognise and work with the grain, they can create games that feel intuitive and engaging. Straying from this grain can lead to confusion, discomfort, or dissatisfaction.

This is not to say that experimentation and innovation should be avoided. Games can and should push boundaries, explore new concepts, and challenge conventions. However, these explorations should be done with a mindful understanding of the grain and how it shapes player expectations and experiences.

In essence, the grain of a game is a compass that guides design decisions, helping to align the game's mechanics, aesthetics, and interactivity with its core purpose. Recognising and embracing this grain enables designers to create experiences that resonate with players, offering them journeys that feel natural, engaging, and deeply satisfying. Conversely, going against the grain without thoughtful consideration can lead to a dissonance that disrupts the player's connection to the game, undermining its impact and appeal.

The lessons learned from understanding the grain in games can also be applied to other mediums and disciplines, including web design and multimedia storytelling. It's a concept that transcends boundaries, offering insights into how we can create more resonant and effective experiences across various platforms and formats. It's about finding that harmony between form and function, where the medium enhances the message rather than working against it.

**Incorporating the History of Text Games into Augmented Text**

In considering the history of human communication, the role of text games over the past half-century offers a fascinating lens through which to view the evolution of interactive storytelling. Text games, or interactive fiction, represent a bridge between traditional narrative forms and the interactive digital experiences that are central to the concept of augmented text. (Reed, 2023) These games have turned readers into players, actively engaging them in the story's progression through text-based inputs and branching paths.

From the early days of mainframe computers to the contemporary scene, text games have provided a unique storytelling medium where the narrative unfolds based on the player's choices. This interactivity represents an early form of augmented text, where the reader is not a passive consumer but an active participant in the communication process. Games like "Zork," "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," and more recent titles such as "80 Days" have shown that text can be a playground for the imagination, providing a space for readers to explore and influence the story.

The potential of text games in the context of augmented text is their demonstrated ability to engage users in a narrative. They compel the reader to take an active role, to make decisions that have consequences within the story, thus providing a deeper level of engagement than static text. By examining the development of text games, the thesis can draw parallels between these interactive narratives and the principles of augmented text. It can show how the engagement strategies developed in text games can inform the design of augmented text, making it more dynamic and responsive.

In digital games, the concept of 'grain' guides the design and player experience, as seen in the examples of Minecraft and visual novels. Augmented Text, in its essence, shares a similar approach but in the realm of written communication. It respects the inherent rhythm and structure of traditional text while introducing elements that enhance understanding and engagement. Unlike games where the deviation from grain can lead to disjointed experiences, Augmented Text aims to maintain the cohesiveness of the narrative, ensuring that any added interactive or multimedia elements are in service of the text's primary goal – to communicate effectively.

### The Grain of Dataviz

Data visualisation represents a powerful tool for communicating complex information, trends, and insights in an accessible and compelling manner. The field experienced a significant surge in popularity in the early 2000s, largely thanks to the pioneering work of Edward Tufte. Tufte's groundbreaking books, including "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information" (1983) and "Envisioning Information," (1990) have inspired countless designers and analysts to explore the potential of visual communication, especially in the context of charts and graphs.

**Embracing the Grain: Tufte's Vision**

Tufte's philosophy emphasised maximising the data-ink ratio, putting more data points into visual communication without unnecessary decorations or embellishments. He advocated for clarity, simplicity, and integrity in design, recognising the unique grain of data visualisation as a medium for conveying quantitative information efficiently and effectively.

This approach has led to some remarkable examples of data visualisation. Sites like 538 and pudding.cool have become renowned for their innovative and insightful visualisations, harnessing the grain of data to offer readers deeper understanding and engagement with complex topics.

**Going Against the Grain: Poor Imitations**

However, the popularity of data visualisation has also led to a proliferation of poor imitations that go against the grain of what the medium is meant to accomplish. These misguided attempts often miss the essence of data visualisation, reducing it to mere graphic design projects without considering the underlying purpose and potential of the medium.

Many bad visualisations seem to prioritise style over substance, obscuring the data's meaning behind flashy visuals, confusing layouts, or unnecessary complexity. In some cases, the information could be more clearly and effectively communicated through simple bullet points or concise text. These examples fail to leverage the unique properties of data visualisation, losing the opportunity to enhance comprehension and insight.

For example, a chart that employs a bewildering array of colours, shapes, and lines without clear labelling or logical organisation can confuse rather than clarify. Such a chart might look visually appealing but fails to convey the intended message or insights, leaving readers frustrated and uninformed.

**Tufte's Misstep: Redesigning the iPhone Stocks App**

Even Tufte himself, the champion of data-rich visualisations, made a notable misstep when he attempted to redesign the iPhone stocks app. His design was guided by his traditional approach of maximising data density, without considering the specific context and constraints of mobile design. (Tufte, 2008)

The result was a cluttered and overwhelming interface that went against the grain of what mobile users typically seek: clear, simple, and user-friendly experiences. Tufte's redesign failed to recognise the unique grain of mobile design, which prioritises ease of use, readability, and focused information delivery.

Tufte responded to critics by saying

> "Several of the critiques began with a user model that described users as superficial, impatient, and inefficient managers of information. What users are impatient about is low-content throughput and space-hogging admin debris, commercials, and lousy interface design. Several critiques relied on a concealed version of the irrelevant Magical Number +/-7 notion.
>
> Well, I don't do Lowest Common Denominator Design.
>
> Lowest Common Denominator Design is a sure road to dumbed-down, content-deprived, interfaces that feature themselves. LCDD is based, at its heart, on contempt for users and for content. Instead, assume that users are smarter about the content at hand than interface designers. Such is often empirically the case; thus the best that design usually can do is to get out of the way and at least do no harm.
>
> More can be expected only at the very highest level, such as Apple."

The discourse initiated by Tufte's comments on design philosophy raises a fundamental question about the role of the designer in shaping user experience. While Tufte advocates for high-quality, data-rich visualisations, his approach in the iPhone Stocks App redesign illuminates a key oversight. The essence of good design, particularly in the context of mobile user interfaces, is not just about data density or aesthetic appeal; it is about understanding and respecting the user's needs and the context in which the application will be used. This user-centric approach is crucial in ensuring that the design serves its intended purpose effectively.

In the realm of data visualisation, it is essential to strike a balance between complexity and usability. The goal should be to create visualisations that are not only informative but also intuitive and accessible to the target audience. Overcomplicating the design with an excessive focus on data density, as seen in Tufte's redesign, can lead to a product that, while theoretically sound, fails in practical application. Users often seek simplicity and clarity, particularly in mobile applications where screen real estate is limited and interaction time is often brief.

Furthermore, this scenario underscores the importance of adaptability in design. Designers must be flexible and responsive to the evolving needs and behaviours of users. In an era where technology and user preferences are constantly changing, clinging to traditional design philosophies without adapting to new contexts can result in products that feel out of touch with user expectations. Successful design in the digital age requires a constant re-evaluation of assumptions and a willingness to evolve alongside the users.

In conclusion, the critique of Tufte's redesign of the iPhone Stocks App serves as a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of prioritizing design ideals over user experience. It reminds us that in the dynamic landscape of technology and design, staying attuned to the users' needs and the specific context of the application is paramount. As we continue to explore and innovate in the field of data visualization and interface design, let us remember that the true measure of success is not just in the sophistication of our creations, but in their ability to resonate with and meet the needs of those who use them.

**Striking the Balance**

The challenges and missteps in the field of data visualisation highlight the importance of understanding and working with the grain of the medium. It's not enough to simply present data in a visual form; designers must recognise the inherent tendencies and capacities of data visualisation as a unique form of communication.

Good data visualisation is not just about aesthetics; it's about conveying meaning, fostering understanding, and engaging the audience. It requires a careful balance of creativity and discipline, innovation and clarity, form and function.

Poorly designed visualisations that go against the grain serve as a cautionary tale, reminding us that adherence to fundamental principles and respect for the medium's grain is essential. It's about recognising the unique characteristics of data visualisation and using them to enhance rather than hinder communication.

In the ever-evolving field of data visualisation, the concept of working with or against the grain remains a guiding principle. From Tufte's pioneering vision to contemporary explorations and missteps, the journey of data visualisation offers valuable lessons in understanding the medium's unique grain.

Whether it's games like Minecraft or visual novels, or the complex world of data visualisation, recognising and embracing the grain leads to resonant and effective experiences. Conversely, going against the grain without thoughtful consideration can lead to dissonance and confusion. It's a concept that transcends disciplines, offering insights into how we can create more meaningful and engaging experiences across various platforms and formats. The challenge lies in finding that harmony between innovation and accessibility, where the technology and design enhance the narrative, not overwhelm it.

The field of data visualisation, especially as influenced by Tufte's principles, focuses on the efficient and effective communication of complex information. Augmented Text, in a similar vein, seeks to make written content more accessible and engaging, often employing data visualisation techniques. However, where data visualisations can sometimes go against the grain by prioritising aesthetic complexity over clarity, Augmented Text carefully balances visual elements with textual content to enhance reader comprehension without overwhelming them.

### The Grain of Text

The concept of working with the grain of a medium has been a guiding principle in various artistic and communicative endeavours. It reflects an alignment with the innate tendencies and capacities of a given medium, allowing creators to craft resonant and effective experiences. However, innovation and exploration often require stepping beyond established boundaries, breaking traditional moulds, and forging new paths. This adventurous spirit of exploration can lead to groundbreaking works that redefine our understanding of the medium itself.

**Breaking the Mould: "House of Leaves"**

An exemplary case of breaking outside the bounds of traditional artistic forms is Mark Z. Danielewski's novel "House of Leaves." Unlike the vast majority of books that can be easily transformed into ePubs or other digital formats, "House of Leaves" defies simple categorisation. It plays with visual design, page numbers, colours, and special codes, making it closer to an artistic artefact than a simple book. As Danielewski says:

> Books don't have to be so limited. They can intensify informational content and experience. Multiple stories can lie side by side on the page.. Words can also be colored and those colors can have meaning. How quickly pages are turned or not turned can be addressed. Hell pages can be tilted, turned upside down, even read backwards... But here's the joke. Books have had this capacity all along... Books are remark- able constructions with enormous possibilities... But somehow the analogue powers of these wonderful bundles of paper have been for- gotten. Somewhere along the way, all its possibilities were denied. I'd like to see that perception change. I'd like to see the book reintroduced for all it really is.

(Hansen, 2004)

The novel's complex layout and multifaceted narrative structure are integral to the reading experience, and they cannot be replicated in standard digital formats. Footnotes lead to appendices, mirrored text demands physical interaction, and different fonts and colours signify various layers of the story. This design goes against the grain of traditional book publishing, turning the physical book into a part of the narrative itself.

This deliberate choice to defy the conventional grain of book design has led to a unique and immersive reading experience, one that challenges readers' expectations and engages them on a deeper level. "House of Leaves" is not just a novel; it is a literary labyrinth that invites exploration, reflection, and active participation.

**Adapting to the Environment: "How Music Works"**

In his 2012 book "How Music Works," David Byrne explores how different kinds of music are impacted by the environment. He illustrates how musical compositions have evolved to reflect the characteristics of the spaces in which they are performed. From grand concert halls to intimate chambers, from boomboxes to headphones, music has adapted to resonate with the grain of the listening experience.

Byrne's insights reveal how understanding and aligning with the grain of the environment can lead to powerful and harmonious musical expressions. The art is not only in crafting the song but also in understanding the "concert hall" it will be played in.

**Nicky Case:**

Nicky Case’s work epitomizes the power of interactive storytelling. Through projects like "Loopy", Case has demonstrated how complex systems and ideas can be conveyed through playful, interactive models. Loopy, for instance, allows users to create and play with dynamic systems, making the abstract concepts of feedback loops and systemic behaviours accessible and understandable. Nicky Case’s creations are not just about passive consumption of information, but about fostering a deeper understanding through interaction and exploration. This approach breaks down the barriers of complexity, making learning a fun and engaging endeavour. (Case, n.d.)

**Integration of Nicky Case's Work into Augmented Text**

Nicky Case's explorables, like "Parable of the Polygons" and "Loopy," embody the essence of augmented text by transforming static narratives into interactive experiences. These explorables are not merely embedded media; they are synergistic with the text, enhancing and expanding upon the written word without overshadowing it. This integration aligns perfectly with the goal of augmented text, which seeks to create a seamless blend of textual and interactive elements. By incorporating these explorables into the narrative, they serve as a bridge between traditional text and modern multimedia, creating a richer, more engaging reader experience.

Case’s work is exemplary in demonstrating the power of interactive storytelling. "Parable of the Polygons" is particularly relevant, using simple shapes and movements to illuminate complex social issues such as segregation and diversity. This interactive model allows users to engage with the content at a deeper level, manipulating variables and witnessing the immediate consequences of their actions. It's a poignant example of how augmented text can elevate understanding through participation.

Similarly, "Loopy" invites users to create and manipulate systems, learning through doing. It's a tool that encourages exploration and experimentation, key aspects of learning that are often undervalued in traditional text. By pulling these examples into the pattern library, your thesis not only acknowledges their value but also provides a framework for others to build upon.

As augmented text seeks to make information more accessible and engaging, Case's explorables serve as a beacon, showing how complex concepts can be distilled into interactive, understandable formats. The challenge lies in analysing these works to extract underlying principles that can be applied broadly to augmented text. It's about finding the balance between the illustrative power of interactivity and the clarity and brevity of the text. Case’s explorables do not replace the text; they enhance it, providing a model for augmented text that is both informative and captivating.

By incorporating these explorables into your thesis, you are not only acknowledging the work of a pioneer in interactive storytelling but also laying the groundwork for future explorations into augmented text. It's a testament to the power of interactivity as a complement to traditional writing, and a step towards a more dynamic, engaging form of communication.

Nicky Case's work is indispensable for the exploration of augmented text. These interactive narratives are more than mere examples; they are the embodiment of the potential that augmented text holds. They show how text can evolve beyond the page, becoming a dynamic tool for education, understanding, and engagement. By integrating these works into your thesis, you highlight the future possibilities of text and set a standard for others to follow.

**Google's interactive explorables**

The exploration of Google's interactive explorables presents an opportunity to observe how a tech giant interprets and applies the concept of augmented text. Their explorables page is a showcase of how interactive elements can be seamlessly integrated with textual information to enhance the user's understanding and engagement. This section will delve into specific examples from Google's repository (Google, n.d.) that embody the principles of augmented text and how they can be applied to educational and informational content.

Google's approach to machine learning visualization is particularly noteworthy. By allowing users to adjust data points and instantly see the algorithm’s response, these explorables simplify the complexities of AI, making them approachable for non-experts. The immediate feedback provided by these tools exemplifies how augmented text can transform the reader's role from passive recipient to active participant.

Another feature worth highlighting is the "scroll through time" function, which offers a dynamic means to visualize change and development. This interactive timeline could serve as a model for illustrating the evolution of communication technologies in your thesis, offering readers a vivid understanding of historical transformations.

These examples of Google's explorables could serve as prototypes for augmented text within the thesis, illustrating the potential of interactive elements to enrich educational narratives. By discussing these tools, the thesis can demonstrate the practical applications of augmented text in simplifying and elucidating complex concepts. This analysis will also provide insights into the design principles that make these explorables effective, such as their intuitive interfaces and the balance between interactivity and informational content.

Through the inclusion of Google's explorables, your thesis can present a compelling argument for the integration of interactive media into traditional text, suggesting a future where digital communication is not only informative but also engaging and interactive. The section will conclude with a critical reflection on how these examples can inform the development of a pattern library for augmented text, which other researchers and practitioners can reference and expand upon.

**Incorporating Bartosz Ciechanowski's Work into Augmented Text**

Bartosz Ciechanowski's site provides an impressive list of interactive articles (Ciechanowski, n.d.) that exemplify the principles of augmented text. His approach to explaining complex topics through interactive graphics and intuitive explanations sets a benchmark for what augmented text can achieve. This section will explore how his work can be dissected to inform and inspire the pattern library of augmented text within the thesis.

Ciechanowski's articles, such as those elucidating the mechanics of cameras or the intricacies of internal combustion engines, go beyond mere illustration; they invite readers to interact with the concepts being discussed. This interactivity transforms the reader's experience from static absorption to dynamic exploration, a key characteristic of augmented text. By manipulating the elements within the articles, readers gain a hands-on understanding, which can be particularly effective for educational purposes.

The relevance of these articles to the thesis lies in their ability to demystify complex subjects, making them accessible to a broader audience. This is achieved not through oversimplification but through the power of interactive visualizations that work in concert with the written content. Each article presents an opportunity to analyze how text and interactive elements can be blended to create an enhanced reading experience.

As the thesis advocates for augmented text as a means of responsive communication, Ciechanowski's work can serve as a case study for implementing such principles effectively. It demonstrates how augmented text can provide clarity and insight into topics that might otherwise be impenetrable to those without specialized knowledge. The integration of these examples into the thesis will not only support the argument for augmented text but will also provide a practical framework for its application.

This exploration will culminate in a discussion of the design and educational philosophies underpinning Ciechanowski's work. The insights gleaned from this analysis will contribute to the development of a set of guidelines for creating augmented text, ensuring that such text is not only informative but also engaging and capable of fostering a deeper level of understanding.

By examining the archives of Ciechanowski, the thesis will bridge the gap between theoretical exploration and practical application, illustrating how augmented text can be used to create powerful and educational narratives. The section will underscore the importance of such work in the evolution of digital communication, positioning it as an integral component of the pattern library that others can draw upon for their own explorations of augmented text.

**"Homestuck": A Multi-Modal Marvel**

Andrew Hussie's 'Homestuck' (Hussie, n.d.) is a webcomic that delights in transcending traditional boundaries and defying categorisation. It is a unique blend of illustration, text, interactive games, and videos, creating a multi-modal experience that engages readers on multiple levels. The narrative is not confined to static images and words on a page; it spills into interactive Flash games, YouTube videos, and even physical merchandise. Hussie's creation doesn't just adhere to the grain of conventional storytelling but revels in exploring the myriad possibilities of digital media. This makes "Homestuck" not merely a webcomic but an expansive narrative universe that invites active participation and exploration.

https://www.homestuck.net/meta/analysis.html

**Web Alternate Reality Games (ARGs)**

The concept of web Alternate Reality Games (ARGs) further expands on this idea of multi-modal storytelling. ARGs blur the lines between fiction and reality, offering immersive experiences that extend beyond traditional media. Players interact with the game through various channels such as websites, social media, phone calls, and real-world events. Clues are dropped everywhere, and players must actively engage with the content, often collaborating with others, to unravel the story. The game is not confined to a single platform or format; it permeates the player's reality, turning the entire world into a playground.

**"LOST": Transmedia Storytelling**

The popular TV show "LOST" explored this space of transmedia storytelling by creating an ARG that accompanied the series. Beyond the television screen, "LOST" fans could delve into websites, fake commercials, and other media that expanded the show's universe. These additional layers of content provided deeper insights into the characters and mysteries of the show, allowing fans to actively participate in the narrative. This approach went against the grain of traditional television watching, turning passive viewers into active participants in a broader storytelling experience. Miller, Vandome, and McBrewster (2009) have explored the ways that internet culture and interactivity began influencing our media landscape in the new century, a trend that has only accelerated since then.

**The New Horizon:**

The initiatives by Google, Nicky Case, Bartosz Ciechanowski, and the broader movement towards Explorable Explanations and Multiverses herald a new era of communication and education. They challenge the status quo, inviting us to reimagine how we interact with information and ideas. It's a shift from static to dynamic, from passive to active, and from siloed to interconnected. As we step into this new horizon, the potential for creating more engaging, insightful, and impactful learning experiences is boundless. These innovations are not just a glimpse into the future of education and communication; they are a call to action for creators, educators, and learners to embrace the interactive, exploratory nature of the digital realm.

The storytelling approaches in "Homestuck" and "LOST" ARGs demonstrate a multi-modal narrative experience that transcends traditional media boundaries. Augmented Text aligns with this innovative spirit but remains anchored in the written word. It takes cues from these multi-modal approaches to create a layered narrative experience, where text is not just a vessel for story but an active participant in the narrative journey. Augmented Text, in this context, becomes a medium where the storytelling grain is both respected and expanded, offering new dimensions to narrative construction and reader engagement.

**Tying It All Together**

Both "Homestuck" and the ARG elements of "LOST" represent a new frontier in storytelling, one that embraces the interconnectedness and flexibility of modern media. They demonstrate that the grain of storytelling is not fixed or rigid but can be shaped, stretched, and reimagined to create rich and engaging experiences. By weaving together various media and allowing readers or viewers to actively engage with the content, creators can build immersive worlds that transcend the limitations of traditional formats. This multi-modal approach to storytelling is not just an innovation; it's a celebration of the endless possibilities of artistic expression in the digital age. Whether through the sprawling narrative of "Homestuck" or the layered mystery of "LOST," these works challenge us to rethink what storytelling can be and invite us to participate in shaping its future.

As we embrace the new horizon of digital interactivity and exploration heralded by the works of Google, Nicky Case, and others, Augmented Text stands as a testament to this evolving landscape. It represents a synthesis of these innovative approaches, offering a unique blend of interactivity and traditional reading. Augmented Text is not just a continuation of the digital evolution in communication and education; it's a leap forward, offering a medium that is dynamic, interactive, and deeply connected to the evolving needs and habits of its audience.

### Beyond HCI

In the realm of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), the focus traditionally has been on creating interfaces that are efficient, intuitive, and straightforward. This approach, while effective in optimising task-oriented interactions, often overlooks the deeper potential of digital media, particularly in the context of narrative and reading experiences. Augmented Text emerges as an extension of the traditional paradigms championed by the field of HCI.

#### Augmented Text: A Shift from Utility to Engagement

HCI, in its conventional form, emphasizes the facilitation of user tasks with maximum efficiency and minimum friction. It's about making tools that people can use easily and effectively. However, Augmented Text introduces a significant shift in this dynamic. Rather than merely serving as a utility, it transforms the reading experience into an interactive journey. Augmented Text is not just about reading words on a page or a screen; it's about engaging with content in a way that is dynamic, interactive, and immersive. This approach marks a departure from traditional HCI principles by not only considering how users interact with text but also how they engage and immerse themselves in it.

#### Convergence of HCI and Narrative Immersion

While both Augmented Text and HCI share a common ground in focusing on the user experience, Augmented Text navigates beyond the usual territory of HCI. It brings in elements of narrative immersion and reader interaction, which are often not the primary focus in traditional HCI. Augmented Text enriches the user experience by incorporating interactive elements like hyperlinks, embedded multimedia, and interactive data visualizations, which allow readers to delve deeper into the content, explore related information, and engage with the material in a more meaningful way.

In Augmented Text, the reader is not just a passive consumer of information but an active participant in the narrative. This interactivity enhances comprehension and retention, as readers are more engaged and involved in the content they are consuming. This level of engagement is a leap from the traditional HCI goal of utility and efficiency, venturing into creating experiences that are enriching and captivating.

#### Aligning with the Grain of HCI

The concept of the 'grain' in HCI refers to designing interfaces that align with user intuition and expectations – creating experiences that feel natural and effortless. Augmented Text, while adhering to this principle, introduces an additional layer of complexity and depth. It weaves interactive elements into the narrative seamlessly, ensuring that these enhancements complement rather than complicate the reading experience.

This alignment does not mean that Augmented Text sacrifices the core principles of HCI. Instead, it builds upon them. It respects the intuitive nature of traditional reading while introducing elements that enrich the experience. The design of Augmented Text is guided by an understanding of how people interact with text, what they expect from it, and how those interactions can be enhanced without disrupting the natural flow of reading.

The key challenge and innovation of Augmented Text in the context of HCI are to integrate these interactive elements in a way that feels intuitive and natural. It's about finding the right balance where the technology enhances the narrative and the user experience, rather than overshadowing or interrupting it.

#### Augmented Text as an Augmentation of HCI

Augmented Text represents a nuanced evolution within the HCI landscape. It transcends the traditional boundaries of utility-focused design, introducing a narrative and experiential depth to digital interactions. By harmoniously blending interactive elements with traditional text, Augmented Text respects the intuitive grain of HCI while pushing its boundaries. It offers a richer, more engaging user experience that goes beyond mere functionality, inviting readers into a new realm of immersive and interactive storytelling. As we continue to explore and innovate in the digital space, Augmented Text stands as a testament to the evolving nature of human-computer interaction, where the lines between utility, engagement, and narrative immersion are artfully blurred.

### Beyond Usability

In the digital domain, 'usability' has long been the cornerstone of design philosophy, focusing on creating user-friendly interfaces that facilitate ease of use and efficient interaction. However, as we journey through the innovative realms of digital communication, Augmented Text presents itself as a revolutionary concept that transcends traditional usability paradigms. It offers a deeper, more nuanced approach to interaction, blending the functional aspects of usability with the enriching qualities of interactive storytelling and reader engagement.

#### Augmented Text: Enriching Usability with Narrative Depth

Usability, in its conventional understanding, hinges on the principles of clarity, simplicity, and efficiency. It aims to minimize user effort and maximize comprehension, ensuring that digital interfaces are accessible and straightforward. Augmented Text, while adhering to these principles, ventures beyond. It doesn't just simplify interaction; it enriches it. By integrating elements such as interactive data visualizations, hyperlinked references, and multimedia content, Augmented Text transforms the act of reading from a passive reception of information into an active exploration.

This integration of interactive elements in text creates a multi-layered experience. Readers are no longer just digesting information; they are interacting with it, probing deeper into topics, and engaging with content in a more meaningful way. Augmented Text, therefore, redefines usability by making the reading experience not just easy but also more insightful and immersive.

#### Symbiosis of Usability and Engagement

While traditional usability emphasizes ease and efficiency, Augmented Text introduces an additional dimension of engagement and exploration. This doesn't mean that usability is compromised; rather, it is enhanced. The interactive elements in Augmented Text are designed to be intuitive and seamlessly integrated, ensuring they don’t disrupt the natural flow of reading but instead complement and enrich it.

In Augmented Text, the definition of usability expands to include the ease of exploring and interacting with content. It's about creating an intuitive narrative journey where readers can easily navigate through different layers of information, make connections, and engage with the content on a deeper level. This expanded notion of usability not only caters to the functional needs of the readers but also addresses their cognitive and experiential needs.

#### Aligning with the Grain of Traditional Reading

Incorporating interactive elements into text challenges designers to respect the 'grain' of traditional reading while introducing new dimensions of interactivity. The grain in this context refers to the natural tendencies and expectations that readers have when engaging with text. Augmented Text aligns with this grain by ensuring that interactive elements enhance rather than disrupt the reading experience.

Designing for Augmented Text requires a delicate balance. The interactive components must be intuitive enough to feel like a natural part of the reading process, yet distinctive enough to offer additional value. This balance is crucial in maintaining the integrity of the text and ensuring that the augmented elements serve to clarify and enrich the content, rather than becoming distractions.

#### Augmented Text as an Enhanced Usability Paradigm

Augmented Text represents a significant leap in the evolution of digital usability. It goes beyond the traditional focus on ease of use and efficiency, introducing elements that elevate the reading experience to new levels of engagement and interactivity. By seamlessly integrating these elements into the narrative flow, Augmented Text respects the inherent grain of reading while expanding its possibilities.

In the broader context of digital communication, Augmented Text stands as a pioneering approach that harmonizes usability with narrative depth and interactive exploration. It challenges us to rethink the boundaries of usability, pushing us towards a future where digital interfaces are not just tools for information retrieval but gateways to immersive and interactive storytelling experiences. As we continue to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of digital design, Augmented Text serves as a beacon, guiding us towards a more integrated, engaging, and enriching interaction with digital content.

### Beyond Apps

In today's digital ecosystem, apps have become ubiquitous, offering specialized solutions for a myriad of tasks and entertainment. However, as we traverse the landscape of digital innovation, Augmented Text emerges as a distinct entity, transcending the conventional confines of app-based interaction. It represents not just another application, but a new paradigm in how we engage with and perceive digital text, marking a significant evolution in the interaction between users and digital content.

#### Augmented Text: Redefining Interaction Beyond Application Boundaries

Apps, by their very nature, are designed to be self-contained, task-oriented, and user-specific. They provide a platform for specific functionalities, whether it’s for productivity, communication, or entertainment. Augmented Text, on the other hand, breaks away from this model. It is not confined within the boundaries of an app but is an intrinsic part of the digital text itself. This integration allows Augmented Text to provide a more holistic and seamless experience, blending the text with interactive elements that extend its capabilities and enrich the reader’s experience.

The essence of Augmented Text lies in its ability to weave interactive and multimedia components directly into the narrative fabric. This integration brings about a transformative reading experience where the text is no longer static but dynamic, responsive, and engaging. Unlike apps, which often redirect users' attention away from the content, Augmented Text keeps users anchored within the narrative, enhancing their understanding and engagement without disrupting the flow.

#### Synergy with the Grain of Digital Reading

In the realm of digital media, each medium has its own 'grain' – a natural direction or tendency that guides its use. Traditional apps align with the grain of task-specific functionality, offering solutions that users seek out for particular purposes. Augmented Text, however, aligns with the grain of digital reading, which encompasses accessibility, engagement, and depth of understanding.

This alignment is critical in ensuring that Augmented Text enhances rather than interrupts the reading experience. The design and integration of interactive elements are done with careful consideration of how people consume digital content. The goal is to make these elements feel like an organic part of the text, offering additional layers of meaning and interaction without pulling readers away from the core narrative.

#### Beyond Conventional App Interaction

Augmented Text offers a paradigm shift in how we interact with digital content. It is not just about providing information or entertainment; it is about creating an immersive and interactive journey within the text itself. This approach goes beyond the conventional app interaction, where the focus is often on singular, isolated tasks. Augmented Text provides a more integrated and cohesive experience, where the boundaries between text, interactivity, and multimedia are blurred, creating a rich tapestry of content that is engaging and informative.

#### Charting a New Course in Digital Interaction

Augmented Text represents a significant stride beyond the conventional framework of apps. It offers a vision of digital interaction that is more integrated, more engaging, and more reflective of the multifaceted nature of digital content consumption. As we continue to explore the possibilities of digital innovation, Augmented Text serves as a harbinger of a new era in digital interaction – one where the distinction between text, apps, and multimedia is not just blurred but meaningfully integrated to enhance the overall user experience. In this new landscape, Augmented Text stands as a testament to the endless potential of digital creativity, charting a course towards a more interconnected and immersive digital world.

# Against the Grain: Where Augmented Text Fails

### Limitations

When Steve Jobs first saw a demo of the Segway scooter, he was misquoted as saying “someday they’ll build cities around this.” The actual quote wasn’t nearly as positive. He was dismissively saying “you’re asking cities to redesign themselves around this.” His point was that products need to coexist within the environment they find themselves in, not arrogantly believe the world will reorient itself to accept the product. The same is true with augmented text. Blogging software and professional-grade content management systems have a certain pattern: type words, add some multimedia to them, and publish. None of the ideas outlined in this paper would work with existing software, and the average CMS or blog user does not have the skills to write the software themselves. So what can we do? First let's detail all the issues with deploying augmented text on any websites, let alone at scale.

#### Technological Compatibility and Integration

The journey begins with the technological landscape. Current content management systems and blogging platforms are predominantly designed for traditional text and basic multimedia. Integrating the sophisticated features of Augmented Text, such as dynamic interactivity and advanced multimedia elements, requires a significant evolution of these platforms. This technological leap presents a challenge: either existing systems must undergo extensive updates, or entirely new systems need to be developed. The feasibility of such extensive technological overhauls remains a question, especially considering the diverse range of platforms in use today.

#### User Skillset and Learning Curve

Another critical challenge lies in the skillset of the average CMS and blogging platform user. Augmented Text demands a blend of skills – from writing and graphic design to technical know-how. For many users, this multidisciplinary approach may be daunting, marked by a steep learning curve. Users accustomed to straightforward text formats may find the transition to Augmented Text overwhelming, potentially leading to resistance or disengagement.

#### Cost and Resource Implications

The development and implementation of Augmented Text are not just technologically demanding but also resource-intensive. The costs associated with software development, system upgrades, and potential hardware requirements could be substantial. For smaller organizations or individual bloggers, these financial implications might be a significant barrier, limiting the reach and adoption of Augmented Text to a more affluent or technologically advanced audience.

#### Content Creation Complexity

Augmented Text redefines content creation, elevating it from simple text composition to a more complex process that involves interactivity and multimedia elements. This complexity presents a challenge for content creators, who must now consider not only the narrative but also how it intertwines with interactive features. Balancing these elements without compromising the clarity and integrity of the content is a skill that might require time and practice to master.

#### User Experience and Accessibility Concerns

In the pursuit of interactive richness, the fundamental aspects of user experience and accessibility cannot be overlooked. Overloading text with interactive features could potentially overwhelm readers, detracting from the essence of the content. Moreover, ensuring that Augmented Text is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, is paramount. Adhering to web accessibility standards is not just a legal requirement but also a moral imperative, ensuring that Augmented Text is inclusive and usable for everyone.

#### Bandwidth and Performance Issues

The inclusion of interactive and multimedia elements in Augmented Text could lead to increased bandwidth requirements and potential performance issues. This is particularly concerning for mobile users, who may face slower load times and a compromised reading experience. Addressing these technical challenges is critical to ensuring that Augmented Text remains efficient and engaging across various devices and connection speeds.

#### Cultural and Behavioral Adaptation

Cultural and behavioral resistance to new technologies is a well-documented phenomenon. Many users may prefer traditional text formats due to their familiarity and simplicity. Encouraging a shift in reading habits and content interaction requires not just technological innovation but also a change in cultural and behavioral attitudes. This transition may be gradual, necessitating patient and persistent efforts to demonstrate the benefits and possibilities of Augmented Text.

#### Data Privacy and Security

In an era where data privacy and security are of paramount concern, the interactive elements of Augmented Text must be scrutinized for potential risks. If these features collect user data for customization or personalization, ensuring the security and privacy of this data is critical. Building trust among users involves transparent policies and robust security measures to protect their information.

#### Standardization and Consistency

The absence of standardized guidelines or frameworks for Augmented Text could lead to inconsistencies in user experience. Establishing industry standards and best practices is essential for creating uniformity in the quality and functionality of Augmented Text across different platforms. This standardization would not only aid content creators but also provide users with a predictable and reliable experience.

#### Market Readiness and Adoption Rate

Finally, the market's readiness to embrace Augmented Text is a pivotal factor in its widespread adoption. In many sectors, traditional text formats are deeply ingrained, and introducing a paradigm shift like Augmented Text requires careful strategizing. The market may exhibit varying degrees of readiness, with some sectors more open to innovation than others. It is essential to gauge this readiness and tailor the introduction of Augmented Text accordingly, ensuring a gradual and strategic roll-out that aligns with market receptiveness.

Overcoming these challenges necessitates a concerted effort from various stakeholders, including technology developers, content creators, educators, and industry leaders. It requires a multifaceted strategy that addresses technological barriers, educates users, fosters a culture of innovation, and ensures a seamless and inclusive user experience.

# Charting a Path Forward for Augmented Text

Let's not bury the lede. No matter how good an idea is, it's unlikely to gain traction without being part of a broader authoring platform. For example, if Wordpress or Apple's iOS AppKit supported the interactions outlined here, it could slowly gain traction and improve over time. But otherwise, most ideas like these languish in whitepapers and modest online experiments. So how might we address this limitation? I suggest a three step process: be realistic, lead by example, and have fun.

**Step one: be realistic**
This thesis outlines about 10 small interactions that illustrate the concepts of Augmented Text, and other authors and researchers could come up with 100 more. Success doesn't require that all 10 of these ideas get built into platforms. Success simply means that this esoteric and academic concept is seen by a handful of people who add their own ideas, write their own implementations, and find places to use these concepts where applicable in their own projects.

**Step two: lead by example**
Nothing inspires software innovation more than competition and user feedback. Imagine that a competitor to Wordpress makes an Augmented Text-centric CMS, and they get some early fans. Over time, maybe they get enough fans to show up on Wordpress' competitive radar. And maybe it becomes enough of a competitive threat for Wordpress to make their own Augmented Text features. This is where the capitalist market works really well: good ideas are requested by customers, and esoteric ideas with an limited audience aren't. It remains to be seen what side Augmented Text will land on.

**Step three: have fun**
Of course marketshare and financial growth aren't the only goals in the world. There are plenty of software projects that never make any money but do one thing well, while bringing satisfaction to the authors and users, as limited as that audience may be. Even if Augmented Text is only ever enjoyed by a small handful of people that read this thesis, that still counts! Seeing a new idea, and being inspired by thinking about things in a new way, has a worth all its own, even if it doesn't become The Next Big Thing. Not every band gets to be the Beatles, but I'd hate to live in a world that only has The Beatles. Bring on the small stuff, the weird stuff, and the boundry-pushing stuff! It might not reach everyone, but it will reach the right people.
