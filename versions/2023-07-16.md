### Abstract
We used to have text, then we had multimedia, but now augmented text allows us to go even further. I’ll survey the state of multimedia today and explain why augmented text addresses scenarios and needs that are unaddressable with multimedia alone. I’ll round out my work with a pattern library of examples that other researchers can use to build on.

### In the beginning, there were words

We’ve always had words. When our ancient ancestors told stories around the fire, they were keeping records for later, passing stories and insights down via oral tradition. There is a rich and detailed history that can be told through words alone, but it wasn’t until we were able to write things down that humans began to make sense of their past.

Sumerian scribes in Mesopotamia, around 3400 BC, laid the groundwork for the first known form of written communication: cuneiform. This intricate system of wedge-shaped marks pressed into clay tablets allowed the recording of inventories, laws, and narratives, marking a quantum leap in the preservation and dissemination of knowledge. This allowed information to outlive its originator and travel beyond the immediate locale, crystallising human thought and making it enduring.

The invention of paper by the Chinese around the 1st century AD and subsequent advent of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in 15th century Europe took this revolution a step further. The Gutenberg Press, in particular, democratised access to information by making books, previously laborious and expensive to produce, affordable and widely available. Knowledge was no longer the exclusive domain of the affluent and the clergy; it was accessible to anyone who could read.

As centuries unfolded, humanity's desire for simpler, more efficient means of communication prompted more advancements. The latter half of the 20th century brought about the desktop publishing revolution, which transitioned the power of the press from large corporations to individuals and small businesses. Computers and software like Adobe's Pagemaker empowered individuals to design, format, and print documents in-house, democratising the creation of print media the way the printing press or the written word democratised things generations before.

Today, the domination of the internet as a communication medium presents the newest chapter in this enduring saga of communication. It enables instantaneous and borderless exchange of ideas, fostering an era of global communication and connection. Words now cascade across screens in real time, melding with other forms of media to create an immersive, digital landscape for expression and understanding.

The evolution from verbal to written communication, and now to digital, has expanded not only the reach of our messages, but also their richness and complexity. Yet, as we delve further into the digital age, we're called upon to reconsider and reimagine how best to harness these tools for effective communication. For while the media may have evolved, the essence of communication – conveying meaning, fostering understanding, and inspiring action – remains constant. We largely plateaued with the advent of “multimedia,” a term that’s nearly 50 years old.

### A survey of multimedia in the current day

Multimedia digital experiences have reached a comfortable and reliable steady-state. Most things are described in text, and sometimes audio visual components such as images, video, and audio are used beside them.

(Refer to The Grain of the Web) But as described in Grain of the Web, effective communication with text and media requires using the right tool for the job. A well-argued essay wouldn’t work as well as a series of images. A comic wouldn’t work as well described orally. A painting wasn’t meant to be a video. There is a “grain” to each media type that guides authors towards how to best use them, and if you go against the grain, they are less effective.

But as versatile and effective as text, video, images, and audio can be, new experiences can emerge when they’re combined together to make new art forms. The most mainstream example of this are video games. They combine audio, visual, and text components together into an overall experience that far exceeds reading text with embedded media beside them. In a word, the difference between the two is interactivity. Standard articles are static and lacking interactivity, whereas games focus their efforts on being interactive, or even immersive. They excel at different forms of communication, but are worse at others. For example, you wouldn’t want to read the novel War and Peace inside Minecraft. But you can’t experience anything like Minecraft in a song.

Simulations live between full-fledged games and traditional written content. Simulations live between full-fledged games and traditional written content. They provide a bridge between the static and the interactive, allowing users to manipulate variables and observe the outcomes. This makes simulations particularly effective for demonstrating complex systems or processes that would be difficult to explain with text or images alone. For example, in the context of climate science, a simulation could allow users to increase or decrease greenhouse gas emissions and observe the effects on global temperature, sea level, and more. The interactivity of simulations supports active learning, as users can explore the system or process at their own pace, experimenting with different scenarios and seeing the results. This helps users to understand not just what happens, but why it happens, deepening their understanding and knowledge retention.

Bret Victor identified this spectrum of communication and coined the term “Explorable Explanations” to describe written content that uses interactive components to communicate concepts more effectively. 

### Exploring Explorable Explanations

Bret Victor introduced the concept of Explorable Explanations to offer a new way of presenting and interacting with text. The core idea is to transform text from mere information to be consumed into an environment to think in. This was envisioned as an umbrella project with the goal of encouraging truly active reading. To make abstract concepts more concrete, Victor proposed the development of reactive documents that allow readers to manipulate authors' assumptions and see the consequences, explorable examples that make abstract concepts concrete, and contextual information that allows readers to learn related material just-in-time and cross-check the author's claims.

Victor's ideas, however, were not completely new. Computing pioneer Alan Kay had previously discussed the concept of active essays which blended computer-based simulations with explanatory text. This was a part of his vision for transforming the computer into a new kind of medium for creative thought, combining the dynamic and interactive nature of the computer with the narrative and argumentative strength of the essay.

These ideas have led to a surge of explorations in the field. Notably, Nicky Case has been instrumental in bringing these ideas to life. One notable example is "Parable of the Polygons", a web-based interactive simulation game that visually demonstrates how small individual biases can lead to large collective biases, thus providing an explorable explanation of systemic societal biases.

This form of explanation has gained traction, with many writers and educators appreciating the value of interactivity in conveying complex ideas. In particular, the medium has been praised for enabling the reader to gain a deeper understanding of the topic by actively participating in the process of exploration and discovery.

Explorable explanations have been further explored and written about by a variety of authors. In particular, the field of education has seen significant interest, with proponents highlighting the potential for these interactive texts to revolutionise learning by promoting active engagement and critical thinking. Other fields, such as journalism and data science, have also begun to incorporate explorable explanations as a means of communicating complex ideas to the public. Overall, Victor's vision for transforming people's relationship with text is finding resonance, sparking a wave of innovative explorations that have the potential to reshape how we interact with information.

But despite all the examples people were experimenting with, it was hard to point to a single example and say “this is an explorable explanation.” What’s the difference between a simulation, a game, an educational game, an explorable, or a multimedia experience? And then came snowfall.

### The Importance of Snowfall

(TODO: do a google scholar search for snowfall — was it before explorable explanations? Nope, explorable explanations was 2011 and snowfall was in the last few days of 2012)

When The New York Times released the "Snow Fall" interactive feature in 2012, it sparked waves of excitement within the digital media industry. This unprecedented piece of multimedia storytelling, a long-form article punctuated by interactive graphics, videos, and immersive animations, seemed to herald the dawn of a new era for online media. Snowfall was a trailblazer, representing a powerful blend of traditional journalistic storytelling and interactive elements, promising an engaging and immersive reader experience.

The innovative approach of Snowfall was met with critical acclaim, winning the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing. Its influence was quickly seen in the proliferation of 'Snowfall-like' features across the digital media landscape, as news outlets and other media organisations sought to emulate its success. The term 'Snowfall' even became a verb within the industry, describing the process of creating rich, multimedia experiences within a long-form article.

However, the initial enthusiasm surrounding Snowfall was soon tempered by the realisation of its inherent challenges. Despite its apparent success, the production of Snowfall was a costly endeavour, both in terms of time and resources. It required a team of skilled developers and designers working intensively over several months to bring the project to fruition. This high level of investment was not a feasible model for most media outlets, particularly for those with smaller budgets or shorter timelines.

Furthermore, the feature was not without technical issues. Users reported numerous bugs, with interactive elements often failing to load properly or behaving inconsistently across different devices and browsers. The high-quality multimedia content, while visually impressive, was also demanding on system resources, leading to slow load times and performance issues for users with less powerful computers or slower internet connections.

These shortcomings highlighted a crucial paradox at the heart of the Snowfall experience. While it demonstrated the immense potential of interactive media and storytelling, it also underscored the technical and economic hurdles that must be overcome to make such experiences accessible and enjoyable for all users. This points towards the need for more scalable and efficient approaches to producing interactive content, as well as better optimisation strategies to ensure smooth performance across a range of devices and connection speeds.


### The Snowfall backlash
In 2015, three years after the launch of Snowfall, Frank Chimero published "The Web's Grain", a seminal piece offering a deep reflection on web design and digital interaction. Chimero's exploration of the web's "grain" can provide us with a valuable perspective when reassessing Snowfall's legacy, as it posits an essential understanding of the fundamental characteristics and potentials of the web as a medium.

The concept of "grain", as Chimero describes it, is a metaphor borrowed from woodworking. It represents the innate tendencies and capacities of any medium or material. The best and most resonant works of design align with the grain of their medium, working with it rather than against it. This notion serves as a guiding principle, illuminating a path for web design that embraces the unique capabilities and affordances of the web.

For Chimero, the web's grain is characterised by flexibility, interconnectedness, and "edgelessness", a term he uses to describe the web's lack of defined boundaries. He argues that a well-designed digital space is fluid and adaptive, reflecting the mutable, ever-changing nature of the web.

While Snowfall was a groundbreaking and pioneering exploration of multimedia storytelling, it was, arguably, somewhat against the web's grain in its execution. The project was complex, resource-intensive, and often glitchy, which resulted in it failing to load properly or behave consistently across different devices and browsers. Moreover, its approach was not scalable for most media outlets, particularly those with limited resources.

Chimero might argue that this approach ran counter to the web's inherent fluidity and adaptability. While the project harnessed some of the web's potential for rich multimedia storytelling, its complex design and performance issues revealed a misalignment with the web's grain.

Yet, despite these flaws, the concept behind Snowfall aligns with Chimero's vision of embracing the web's unique capacities. The New York Times's interactive feature represents an attempt to leverage the web's potential for creating immersive, interconnected experiences that transcend traditional linear storytelling. Even though its execution was not perfect, the ambition and innovation behind Snowfall signalled a step towards more engaging and interactive forms of online content.

Chimero’s essay urges us to step back from the precipice of overcomplicated, overly-ambitious design and to reconsider the fundamental properties of the web – a more versatile, flexible and inherently complex medium than any that have come before. This call for a return to simplicity, however, is not a call for stagnation or resistance against innovation. Rather, it is a challenge to embrace the medium in its fullness, harness its unique properties, and wield these attributes to push the boundaries of digital storytelling.

Seen through this lens, "Snowfall" isn’t so much a failed experiment, but an important milestone that stretched the conceptual limits of online communication. It unveiled a tantalising glimpse of the web’s potential while laying bare the challenges of aligning with the web’s unique grain. This experience showed us the value in creating digital narratives that are innovative, accessible, and engaging – narratives that ride with the web's grain rather than against it.

The promise of Snowfall, then, isn't in the specific form it took but rather the vision it represented – a vision of using the web's unique capacities for storytelling, learning, and understanding. It's about blending the strengths of the medium with content, not wedging content into unwieldy software experiences.

However, to translate this vision into practice, we need to focus on what makes online documents successful: text, video, images, and embedded widgets. These components are not just passive containers of information, but dynamic instruments of communication, each with its unique way of engaging users and conveying meaning.

In addition to these, we introduce the concept of responsive communication - an innovative approach that focuses on enhancing comprehension and interactivity. To truly harness the web's grain, we must design digital experiences that respond to users' actions and adapt to their needs. These can range from interactive diagrams that users can manipulate to gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter, to smart annotations that provide additional information on demand, to simulations that allow users to explore different scenarios and outcomes.

These components create a more holistic and immersive experience. They do not function as separate, disconnected pieces wedged into a page but as a cohesive whole. They become a part of the narrative, supplementing and enhancing the main text rather than distracting from it.

But, as we move towards embracing these new tools and approaches, we must not lose sight of the core of all communication: words. The fundamental purpose of any digital communication, no matter how visually stunning or interactively engaging, is to convey meaning through content.

Therefore, we propose creating a component library - a collection of versatile, reusable components that seamlessly integrate into the narrative flow, enhancing the storytelling and learning process. A tool like this allows us to avoid the pitfall of overcomplication, keeping us grounded in our ultimate goal: to communicate effectively.

In essence, our journey from Snowfall, through The Web's Grain, and back to words represents a shift in our understanding and approach to digital storytelling. It's about recognising the unique grain of the web and using it to create more meaningful, effective, and engaging experiences. It's about finding that sweet spot between innovation and accessibility, where the technology enhances the narrative rather than overwhelming it.

### Introducing the component library

**Before and After Slider**

What it is: A 'before and after' slider is a visual tool that allows users to compare two versions of an image by sliding a control left and right. It can reveal changes, contrasts, or progress over time in a way that is immediate and striking.

Why it's better than simple text: Text can describe differences, but the slider allows for a visual, direct comparison that can be more impactful and easier to grasp. It's a concrete, visual way to present contrasts or changes.

Why it's better than launching a widget: The slider is incorporated directly into the page, offering a seamless experience. There's no need to open a separate widget or leave the current context, ensuring the flow of information remains uninterrupted.

Notable examples: This tool has been used effectively in various fields, including journalism, where The New York Times has used it to show the impacts of natural disasters on landscapes, and in retail, where it's used to demonstrate the effects of products.

Inventors: The exact origin is unclear, but it's a widely-used tool in web development, with many open-source versions available.

**Last Read Indicator**

What it is: A 'last read' indicator is a tool that marks the last point in a text that a user read, allowing them to pick up where they left off when they return to the document.

Why it's better than simple text: Reading long documents can be daunting, and it's easy to lose your place. The 'last read' indicator solves this problem by providing a visual bookmark, enhancing usability.

Why it's better than launching a widget: The indicator is built into the document, meaning it's always present and doesn't interrupt the reading experience. There's no need to launch a separate tool or navigate away from the page.

Notable examples: E-book platforms like Kindle employ this feature to improve user experience. Medium, a popular blogging platform, also utilises a similar feature.

Inventors: This tool has become a standard feature in e-book reading applications and platforms, and its exact origin is hard to pinpoint.

**Article Diff**

What it is: An 'article diff' tool allows users to compare different versions of an article or document, showing the additions, deletions, and modifications between them. This is similar to the 'track changes' feature in word processing software but integrated into the web interface.

Why it's better than simple text: It provides an efficient way to see the evolution of a document or the changes made, beyond what could be communicated through text alone.

Why it's better than launching a widget: An 'article diff' is directly incorporated into the webpage, meaning users can instantly access and navigate the changes without the need to load a separate tool or application.

Notable examples: Wikipedia uses a similar feature to track changes in its pages, while GitHub uses it for tracking changes in code.

Inventors: The concept is borrowed from programming, where 'diff' tools have long been used to compare different versions of code.

**Interactive Graph (Compound Interest)**

What it is: An interactive graph for compound interest visualizes how an initial investment grows over time, taking into account both the initial deposit and the accumulated interest. Users can manipulate variables (like interest rate, time, or initial deposit) to see how changes impact the growth of the investment.

Why it's better than simple text: Text explanations of compound interest can be abstract and hard to grasp. An interactive graph makes the concept concrete and allows users to experiment and see the impact of different variables directly.

Why it's better than launching a widget: Embedding the interactive graph into the page keeps the user in the context of the broader content, maintaining the flow of information and engagement.

Notable examples: Various financial and educational websites use interactive compound interest calculators, such as Investopedia and Khan Academy.

Inventors: The concept of an interactive compound interest graph likely arose with the advent of financial technology tools designed to educate and engage consumers in personal finance.

**Summarise Widget**

What it is: A 'summarise' widget is a tool that automatically generates a concise summary of a larger text. This could be a paragraph that summarises an article, key points from a speech, or the main ideas of a chapter, for instance.

Why it's better than simple text: It provides a quick way to understand the main points of a long text, offering a 'digest' version for those short on time or seeking to preview the content.

Why it's better than launching a widget: The summarise widget can be built directly into the webpage, immediately available to the user without interrupting their reading flow.

Notable examples: Some online learning platforms use this tool to provide summaries of lengthy lectures or course materials.

Inventors: Summarisation technology has been developed by many companies and researchers in the field of natural language processing and machine learning.

**Digital Patina**. 
What it is: Digital patina refers to design elements that change over time to reflect usage, akin to how physical objects acquire a patina with age. This can take many forms on a website, such as a colour change on frequently-clicked buttons or wear marks on often-viewed pages.

Why it's better than simple text: Digital patina adds a layer of interaction and personalisation that simple text can't provide, making the user experience more engaging and visually interesting.

Why it's better than launching a widget: Digital patina is integrated into the design of the page or site, subtly enhancing the user experience without the need for launching separate widgets.

Notable examples: There are yet few examples of digital patina in web design, but its principles can be seen in software like music streaming service Spotify, where frequently played songs are highlighted.

Inventors: The concept of digital patina has been discussed in academic circles, particularly in the field of Human-Computer Interaction, but its application in web design is still emerging.

**Cite Pull-Forward**. 

What it is: A 'cite pull-forward' is a feature that brings citation information (such as the author, publication date, or source title) into the main body of text when you hover over or click on an in-text citation. It provides an easy way for readers to check sources without leaving their place in the text.

Why it's better than simple text: It provides an instant, convenient way for readers to verify and understand the context of information, improving transparency and trust in the content.

Why it's better than launching a widget: The 'cite pull-forward' function maintains the reader's engagement and focus, offering a smoother reading experience compared to having to navigate to a separate widget or the end of the document for the full citation.

Notable examples: Some academic databases and journal websites incorporate a similar feature, improving the reading experience for researchers.

Inventors: The 'cite pull-forward' feature has emerged from digital academic and publishing circles, though its precise origin is unclear.
