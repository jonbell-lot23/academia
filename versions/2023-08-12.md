### Abstract
The history of human communication started with speech, evolved to include text, and in modern times added interactivity and multimedia. Augmented text allows us to go even further by adding bite-sized software interactivity into traditional reading experiences. In this paper, I’ll survey the state of multimedia today and explain why augmented text addresses scenarios and needs that are unaddressable with multimedia alone. I’ll round out my work with a pattern library of examples that other researchers can build on.

### In the beginning, there were words

Human society is built on words. When our ancient ancestors told stories around the fire, they were keeping records for later, passing stories and insights down via oral tradition. (TODO: refer to Noam Chomsky’s linguistic theories, about how language is built into our wiring) This gave human civilisation a rich oral tradition to learn from and be inspired by, but it wasn’t until the invention of writing that human communication was able to evolve from hearsay to something more tangible and verifiable. (TODO: other references would be good here too)

Around 3400 BC, Sumerian scribes in Mesopotamia laid the groundwork for the first known form of written communication, called cuneiform. (TODO: reference) This intricate system of wedge-shaped marks pressed into clay tablets allowed the recording of inventories, laws, and narratives, marking a significant improvement around how humankind preserved and disseminated  knowledge. This allowed information to outlive its author and be shared with audiences for the first time. The impact of this was huge. (TODO: reference)

The invention of paper by the Chinese around the 1st century AD and subsequent advent of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in 15th century Europe took the revolution a step further. The Gutenberg Press democratised access to information by making books, previously laborious and expensive to produce, affordable and widely available. Knowledge was no longer the exclusive domain of the affluent and the clergy; it was accessible to anyone who could read. The impact of this was huge. (TODO: I’m setting up a story arc here, but obviously saying “huge” twice isn’t going to cut it. Find a way to make these paragraphs rhyme and fit into a broader arc/theme)

The evolution from spoken word to written, then from expensive to cheap, set up the desktop and internet revolutions of the late 20th century, followed by the explosion of smartphone usage, which made communication as cheap and plentiful as it’s ever been. Today, the combination of the internet and mobile devices presents the newest chapter in this enduring saga of communication.  Yet, as we delve further into the digital age, we're called upon to reconsider and reimagine how best to harness these tools for effective communication. For while the media may have evolved, the essence of communication – conveying meaning, fostering understanding, and inspiring action – remains constant. We largely plateaued with the advent of “multimedia,” a term that’s nearly 50 years old. (TODO: maybe pull in “50 years of text games here)

(TODO: Segue that talks about how stories around the campfire, cave paintings, and basic books have analogues today and have in fact barely evolved from their original forms. Now they’re just tv shows, podcasts, websites, and ebooks)

### A survey of multimedia in the current day
(TODO: maybe this is less of a survey and more of an introduction to interactivity? Maybe that can tie to 50 years of text games?)

Multimedia digital experiences have reached a comfortable and reliable steady-state. Most things are described in text, and sometimes audio visual components such as images, video, and audio are used beside them.

(TODO: Refer to The Grain of the Web) But as described in Grain of the Web, effective communication with text and media requires using the right tool for the job. A well-argued essay wouldn’t work as well as a series of images. A comic wouldn’t work as well described orally. A painting wasn’t meant to be a video. There is a “grain” to each media type that guides authors towards how to best use them, and if you go against the grain, they are less effective.

(TODO: introduce interactivity better)  

But as versatile and effective as text, video, images, and audio can be, new experiences can emerge when they’re combined together to make new art forms. Video games are the best example of this. They combine audio, visual, and text components together into an overall experience that far exceeds reading text with embedded media beside them. In a word, the difference between the two is interactivity. Standard articles are static and lacking interactivity, whereas games focus their efforts on being interactive, or even immersive. They excel at different forms of communication, but are worse at others. For example, you wouldn’t want to read the novel War and Peace inside Minecraft. But you can’t experience anything like Minecraft in a song.

Simulations live between full-fledged games and traditional written content. They provide a bridge between the static and the interactive, allowing users to manipulate variables and observe the outcomes. This makes simulations particularly effective for demonstrating complex systems or processes that would be difficult to explain with text or images alone. For example, in the context of climate science, a simulation could allow users to increase or decrease greenhouse gas emissions and observe the effects on global temperature, sea level, and more. The interactivity of simulations supports active learning, as users can explore the system or process at their own pace, experimenting with different scenarios and seeing the results. This helps users to understand not just what happens, but why it happens, deepening their understanding and knowledge retention.

Bret Victor identified this spectrum of communication and coined the term “Explorable Explanations” to describe written content that uses interactive components to communicate concepts more effectively. 

### “Explorable Explanations” and “Active Essays”

Bret Victor introduced the concept of Explorable Explanations to offer a new way of presenting and interacting with text. The core idea is to transform text from mere information to be consumed into an environment to think in. This was envisioned as an umbrella project with the goal of encouraging truly active reading. To make abstract concepts more concrete, Victor proposed the development of reactive documents that allow readers to manipulate authors' assumptions and see the consequences, explorable examples that make abstract concepts concrete, and contextual information that allows readers to learn related material just-in-time and cross-check the author's claims.

Victor's ideas, however, were not completely new. Computing pioneer Alan Kay had previously discussed the concept of active essays which blended computer-based simulations with explanatory text. This was a part of his vision for transforming the computer into a new kind of medium for creative thought, combining the dynamic and interactive nature of the computer with the narrative and argumentative strength of the essay.

These ideas have led to a surge of explorations in the field. Notably, Nicky Case has been instrumental in bringing these ideas to life. One notable example is "Parable of the Polygons", a web-based interactive simulation game that visually demonstrates how small individual biases can lead to large collective biases, thus providing an explorable explanation of systemic societal biases.

(TODO: I have so many references and citations I can put here, so I should)

This form of explanation has gained traction, with many writers and educators appreciating the value of interactivity in conveying complex ideas. In particular, the medium has been praised for enabling the reader to gain a deeper understanding of the topic by actively participating in the process of exploration and discovery.

Explorable explanations have been further explored and written about by a variety of authors. In particular, the field of education has seen significant interest, with proponents highlighting the potential for these interactive texts to revolutionise learning by promoting active engagement and critical thinking. Other fields, such as journalism and data science, have also begun to incorporate explorable explanations as a means of communicating complex ideas to the public. Overall, Victor's vision for transforming people's relationship with text is finding resonance, sparking a wave of innovative explorations that have the potential to reshape how we interact with information.

But despite all the examples people were experimenting with, it was hard to point to a single example and say “this is an explorable explanation.” What’s the difference between a simulation, a game, an educational game, an explorable, or a multimedia experience? And then came snowfall.

(TODO: Refer to that one piece about explorable explanations that asks a lot of these questions, gets some answers, but largely shrugs it off)

### The Importance of Snowfall

(TODO: source, source, source)
(TODO: do a google scholar search for snowfall — was it before explorable explanations? Nope, explorable explanations was 2011 and snowfall was in the last few days of 2012)

When The New York Times released the "Snow Fall" interactive feature in 2012, it sparked waves of excitement within the digital media industry. This unprecedented piece of multimedia storytelling, a long-form article punctuated by interactive graphics, videos, and immersive animations, seemed to herald the dawn of a new era for online media. Snowfall was a trailblazer, representing a powerful blend of traditional journalistic storytelling and interactive elements, promising an engaging and immersive reader experience.

The innovative approach of Snowfall was met with critical acclaim, winning the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing. Its influence was quickly seen in the proliferation of 'Snowfall-like' features across the digital media landscape, as news outlets and other media organisations sought to emulate its success. The term 'Snowfall' even became a verb within the industry, describing the process of creating rich, multimedia experiences within a long-form article.

However, the initial enthusiasm surrounding Snowfall was soon tempered by the realisation of its inherent challenges. Despite its apparent success, the production of Snowfall was a costly endeavour, both in terms of time and resources. It required a team of skilled developers and designers working intensively over several months to bring the project to fruition. This high level of investment was not a feasible model for most media outlets, particularly for those with smaller budgets or shorter timelines.

Furthermore, the feature was not without technical issues. Users reported numerous bugs, with interactive elements often failing to load properly or behaving inconsistently across different devices and browsers. The high-quality multimedia content, while visually impressive, was also demanding on system resources, leading to slow load times and performance issues for users with less powerful computers or slower internet connections.

These shortcomings highlighted a crucial paradox at the heart of the Snowfall experience. While it demonstrated the immense potential of interactive media and storytelling, it also underscored the technical and economic hurdles that must be overcome to make such experiences accessible and enjoyable for all users. This points towards the need for more scalable and efficient approaches to producing interactive content, as well as better optimisation strategies to ensure smooth performance across a range of devices and connection speeds.

(TODO: this is a great place for talking about the grain of the web more)

### The Snowfall backlash
In 2015, three years after the launch of Snowfall, Frank Chimero published "The Web's Grain", a seminal piece offering a deep reflection on web design and digital interaction. Chimero's exploration of the web's "grain" can provide us with a valuable perspective when reassessing Snowfall's legacy, as it posits an essential understanding of the fundamental characteristics and potentials of the web as a medium.

The concept of "grain", as Chimero describes it, is a metaphor borrowed from woodworking. It represents the innate tendencies and capacities of any medium or material. The best and most resonant works of design align with the grain of their medium, working with it rather than against it. This notion serves as a guiding principle, illuminating a path for web design that embraces the unique capabilities and affordances of the web.

For Chimero, the web's grain is characterised by flexibility, interconnectedness, and "edgelessness", a term he uses to describe the web's lack of defined boundaries. He argues that a well-designed digital space is fluid and adaptive, reflecting the mutable, ever-changing nature of the web.

While Snowfall was a groundbreaking and pioneering exploration of multimedia storytelling, it was, arguably, somewhat against the web's grain in its execution. The project was complex, resource-intensive, and often glitchy, which resulted in it failing to load properly or behave consistently across different devices and browsers. Moreover, its approach was not scalable for most media outlets, particularly those with limited resources.

Chimero might argue that this approach ran counter to the web's inherent fluidity and adaptability. While the project harnessed some of the web's potential for rich multimedia storytelling, its complex design and performance issues revealed a misalignment with the web's grain.

Yet, despite these flaws, the concept behind Snowfall aligns with Chimero's vision of embracing the web's unique capacities. The New York Times's interactive feature represents an attempt to leverage the web's potential for creating immersive, interconnected experiences that transcend traditional linear storytelling. Even though its execution was not perfect, the ambition and innovation behind Snowfall signalled a step towards more engaging and interactive forms of online content.

Chimero’s essay urges us to step back from the precipice of overcomplicated, overly-ambitious design and to reconsider the fundamental properties of the web – a more versatile, flexible and inherently complex medium than any that have come before. This call for a return to simplicity, however, is not a call for stagnation or resistance against innovation. Rather, it is a challenge to embrace the medium in its fullness, harness its unique properties, and wield these attributes to push the boundaries of digital storytelling.

Seen through this lens, "Snowfall" isn’t so much a failed experiment, but an important milestone that stretched the conceptual limits of online communication. It unveiled a tantalising glimpse of the web’s potential while laying bare the challenges of aligning with the web’s unique grain. This experience showed us the value in creating digital narratives that are innovative, accessible, and engaging – narratives that ride with the web's grain rather than against it.

The promise of Snowfall, then, isn't in the specific form it took but rather the vision it represented – a vision of using the web's unique capacities for storytelling, learning, and understanding. It's about blending the strengths of the medium with content, not wedging content into unwieldy software experiences.

However, to translate this vision into practice, we need to focus on what makes online documents successful: text, video, images, and embedded widgets. These components are not just passive containers of information, but dynamic instruments of communication, each with its unique way of engaging users and conveying meaning.

In addition to these, we introduce the concept of responsive communication - an innovative approach that focuses on enhancing comprehension and interactivity. To truly harness the web's grain, we must design digital experiences that respond to users' actions and adapt to their needs. These can range from interactive diagrams that users can manipulate to gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter, to smart annotations that provide additional information on demand, to simulations that allow users to explore different scenarios and outcomes.

These components create a more holistic and immersive experience. They do not function as separate, disconnected pieces wedged into a page but as a cohesive whole. They become a part of the narrative, supplementing and enhancing the main text rather than distracting from it.

But, as we move towards embracing these new tools and approaches, we must not lose sight of the core of all communication: words. The fundamental purpose of any digital communication, no matter how visually stunning or interactively engaging, is to convey meaning through content.

Therefore, we propose creating a component library - a collection of versatile, reusable components that seamlessly integrate into the narrative flow, enhancing the storytelling and learning process. A tool like this allows us to avoid the pitfall of over-complication, keeping us grounded in our ultimate goal: to communicate effectively.

In essence, our journey from Snowfall, through The Web's Grain, and back to words represents a shift in our understanding and approach to digital storytelling. It's about recognising the unique grain of the web and using it to create more meaningful, effective, and engaging experiences. It's about finding that sweet spot between innovation and accessibility, where the technology enhances the narrative rather than overwhelming it.

### Introducing the component library

**Before and After Slider**

What it is:

A 'before and after' slider is a visual tool that allows users to compare two versions of an image by sliding a control left and right. It can reveal changes, contrasts, or progress over time in a way that is immediate and striking.

Notable examples:

This tool has been used effectively in various fields, including journalism, where The New York Times has used it to show the impacts of natural disasters on landscapes, and in retail, where it's used to demonstrate the effects of products.

Why it's better than simple text:

Text can describe differences, but the slider allows for a visual, direct comparison that can be more impactful and easier to grasp. It's a concrete, visual way to present contrasts or changes.

Why it's better than launching a widget:

The slider is incorporated directly into the page, offering a seamless experience. There's no need to open a separate widget or leave the current context, ensuring the flow of information remains uninterrupted.

Inventors: The exact origin is unclear, but it's a widely-used tool in web development, with many open-source versions available.

**Last Read Indicator**

What it is:

A 'last read' indicator is a tool that marks the last point in a text that a user read, allowing them to pick up where they left off when they return to the document.

Notable examples: (look for some)

Why it's better than simple text:

Reading long documents can be daunting, and it's easy to lose your place. The 'last read' indicator solves this problem by providing a visual bookmark, enhancing usability.

Why it's better than launching a widget:

The indicator is built into the document, meaning it's always present and doesn't interrupt the reading experience. There's no need to launch a separate tool or navigate away from the page.

Inventors: probably none?

**Article Diff**

What it is:

An 'article diff' tool allows users to compare different versions of an article or document, showing the additions, deletions, and modifications between them. This is similar to the 'track changes' feature in word processing software but integrated into the web interface.

Notable examples: 

Wikipedia uses a similar feature to track changes in its pages, while GitHub uses it for tracking changes in code.

Why it's better than simple text:

It provides an efficient way to see the evolution of a document or the changes made, beyond what could be communicated through text alone.

Why it's better than launching a widget: 

An 'article diff' is directly incorporated into the webpage, meaning users can instantly access and navigate the changes without the need to load a separate tool or application.

Inventors:

The concept is borrowed from programming, where 'diff' tools have long been used to compare different versions of code.

**Interactive Graph (Compound Interest)**

What it is: 

An interactive graph for compound interest visualizes how an initial investment grows over time, taking into account both the initial deposit and the accumulated interest. Users can manipulate variables (like interest rate, time, or initial deposit) to see how changes impact the growth of the investment.

Why it's better than simple text: 

Text explanations of compound interest can be abstract and hard to grasp. An interactive graph makes the concept concrete and allows users to experiment and see the impact of different variables directly.

Why it's better than launching a widget: Embedding the interactive graph into the page keeps the user in the context of the broader content, maintaining the flow of information and engagement.

Notable examples: 

Various financial and educational websites use interactive compound interest calculators, such as Investopedia and Khan Academy. (Sorted.co.nz?)

Inventors:

The concept of an interactive compound interest graph likely arose with the advent of financial technology tools designed to educate and engage consumers in personal finance.

**Summarise Widget**

What it is:

A 'summarise' widget is a tool that automatically generates a concise summary of a larger text. This could be a paragraph that summarises an article, key points from a speech, or the main ideas of a chapter, for instance.

Why it's better than simple text: 

It provides a quick way to understand the main points of a long text, offering a 'digest' version for those short on time or seeking to preview the content.

Why it's better than launching a widget:

The summarise widget can be built directly into the webpage, immediately available to the user without interrupting their reading flow.

Notable examples: 

Some online learning platforms use this tool to provide summaries of lengthy lectures or course materials.

Inventors: 

Summarisation technology has been developed by many companies and researchers in the field of natural language processing and machine learning.

**Digital Patina**. 

What it is: 

Digital patina refers to design elements that change over time to reflect usage, akin to how physical objects acquire a patina with age. This can take many forms on a website, such as a colour change on frequently-clicked buttons or wear marks on often-viewed pages.

Why it's better than simple text: 

Digital patina adds a layer of interaction and personalisation that simple text can't provide, making the user experience more engaging and visually interesting.

Why it's better than launching a widget: 

Digital patina is integrated into the design of the page or site, subtly enhancing the user experience without the need for launching separate widgets.

Notable examples: 

(BBC example from 2003 or so)

Inventors: BBC perhaps?

**Cite Pull-Forward**. 

What it is:

A 'cite pull-forward' is a feature that brings citation information (such as the author, publication date, or source title) into the main body of text when you hover over or click on an in-text citation. It provides an easy way for readers to check sources without leaving their place in the text.

Why it's better than simple text:

It provides an instant, convenient way for readers to verify and understand the context of information, improving transparency and trust in the content.

Why it's better than launching a widget:

The 'cite pull-forward' function maintains the reader's engagement and focus, offering a smoother reading experience compared to having to navigate to a separate widget or the end of the document for the full citation.

Notable examples:

Some academic databases and journal websites incorporate a similar feature, improving the reading experience for researchers.

Inventors: (I think the guy who thinks AI will kill us all did this first?)

## Research proposal

[This is a living document. Find the latest version here][10] 

MASTERS OF DESIGN STUDY RESEARCH PROPOSAL 
DRIL stream: Interaction and Design 
Proposed Supervisor: Walter Langelaar 
Funding (if applicable): N/A 
External Partner/s (if applicable): N/A 
Working Research Project title: Augmented Text: A New Frontier in Responsive Communication 

Project Overview: 

My work will explore the exciting but overlooked space between standard text-based content and fully interactive software. Scholars and inventors as far back as Alan Kay (2003) have called for the creation of “active essays” and more recently Bret Victor has advocated for Explorable Explanations, (2011) which inspired powerful new works such as the Pulitzer-winning Snowfall from the New York Times (2012). Still, the practice is outside the mainstream. My research will help the reader think about text as an interactive experience where writing isn’t just something to be consumed, but is instead an environment to think in. 

Research Project Description: 

My research will feature an survey of innovative and influential examples of augmented text to date. From these sources, I will distill core concepts, strategies, and approaches that have proven successful in engaging readers and enhancing understanding. The central focus of my work will be contributing to this under-appreciated field. I'll build a comprehensive pattern library featuring practical, applicable examples of augmented text techniques. 

Each pattern in the library will be accompanied by working code and an interactive prototype. These will serve as a springboard for future exploration and innovation by designers and developers. This pattern library will stand as a practical, hands-on companion to the theoretical knowledge drawn from my research. 

In this project, I am aiming to do more than just synthesize what has been done. I hope to inspire, enabling others to build on past achievements and explore new frontiers in the realm of responsive communication. After reading my work, readers will not only appreciate the art of what's been done in the past but will also be equipped to add to the future of augmented text and responsive communication. 

Research Methods: 

My research approach focuses on two primary methods: historical exploration and authoring a pattern library. To better understand the evolution of Augmented Text and Responsive Communication, I will conduct a survey of prominent examples in the field. This archival research will inform the development of a detailed timeline, placing each example within its historical and cultural context. By understanding the lineage of these techniques, we can glean insights into why certain methods have evolved, which have stood the test of time, and what patterns have emerged over the years. 

The centerpiece of my research will be the development of an open-sourced pattern library. This practical, hands-on endeavor involves considerable design and development effort. The patterns will be drawn from the myriad examples identified in my historical survey, as well as from contemporary practices and my own design explorations. Each pattern in the library will be a real, working prototype, providing a tangible and interactive demonstration of the concept it represents. The pattern library will serve as both an encapsulation of current best practices and a tool for further exploration and innovation. 

This approach combines historical research with practical design development. It allows me to both study the field as it has developed and contribute directly to its future. By applying what I learn from the historical survey to the creation of the pattern library, I aim to offer a comprehensive, practical, and forward-looking resource for those interested in Augmented Text and Responsive Communication. This process of active investigation and creation provides a rich understanding of the field and lays the groundwork for future research and design advancements. 

Research Outputs: 

The centerpiece of this research will be a comprehensive research paper, spanning between 8,000 to 30,000 words, that lays out the history, theory, and application of Augmented Text and Responsive Communication. This document will be available in PDF form for traditional academic consumption. 

However, to fully embrace the topic of study, the same content will be presented as an interactive online essay. This digital rendition will incorporate live examples of augmented text and responsive communication, creating an experiential learning environment for readers and embodying the principles it discusses. 

Complementing the research paper, I will also produce an open-sourced pattern library. This practical resource will host a collection of interactive patterns drawn from my research, each one a fully functioning example of Augmented Text. It is my hope that this pattern library will not only illustrate the concepts discussed in the research paper but will also serve as a source of inspiration and a toolkit for other designers and developers venturing into this exciting frontier of digital communication. 

Research Plan: 

Month 1 (MVP) 

With the knowledge already gained in the field, a preliminary draft of the entire research paper will be constructed. This is a methodology that has proven successful in industry settings—create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) quickly and proceed to iterate based on its foundation. This is non-standard, because a literature review typically comes first, but I think this will give me the best chance of success because it gives me more time to iterate. 

Months 2-4 (Development) 

Pattern Library Development (Month 2-4) The next three months will be dedicated to writing code for the pattern library. Leveraging the insights from the initial draft, a series of interactive examples showcasing the potential of augmented text and responsive communication will be developed. By the end of this phase, a concrete vision of the research's direction, inclusive of the practical example library, will be achieved. 

Months 5-7 (Literature and peer review) 

In these three months, the paper and code examples will be scrutinized, iterated upon, and improved. The draft research paper will be shared with peers and experts for their feedback. In parallel, a literature review will be conducted to understand how the project relates to, deviates from, and augments the existing body of knowledge. 

Months 8-9 (Iteration) 

Taking into account the new learnings, feedback, and insights from the previous phase, the paper and the code examples will be revised, refined, and expanded upon. This iterative process ensures the research paper and the pattern library are at the cutting edge of the field and provide substantial contribution. 

Months 10-12 (Refinement) 

The final three months will serve as bonus time to polish all aspects of the research. This phase includes the final revisions of the paper, fine-tuning of the code examples, addressing any remaining feedback or uncovered issues, and preparing for the final submission. This period provides an opportunity to ensure that the research stands up to the rigors of academic scrutiny while remaining a practical and useful contribution to the field.
