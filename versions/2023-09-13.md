# Augmented Text: A New Frontier in Responsive Communication 

#### Last update: 3 September, 2023
#### 8056 words (6922 without the research proposal, which is 1134)

### Abstract
The history of human communication started with speech, evolved to include text, and in modern times added interactivity. Since then, multimedia has been in a steady-state with not much improvement. In this paper, I’ll survey the state of multimedia today and explain why augmented text addresses scenarios and needs that are unaddressable with traditional multimedia alone. I’ll round out my work with a pattern library of examples that other researchers can build on.

### In the beginning, there were words

**Todos/References**
* Noam Chomsky reference
* Cuneiform reference (what it is, what the impact was)

**Todos/Other**
* Pull in 50 years of text games perhaps
* Story arc: talk about how the old methods of communication are similar to the new ones

Human society is built on words. When our ancient ancestors told stories around the fire, they were keeping records for later, passing stories and insights down via oral tradition. (TODO: refer to Noam Chomsky’s linguistic theories, about how language is built into our wiring) This brought significant benefits to human civilisation, but it wasn’t until the invention of writing that  communication was able to evolve from hearsay to something more tangible and verifiable. (TODO: other references would be good here too)

Around 3400 BC, Sumerian scribes in Mesopotamia laid the groundwork for the first known form of written communication, called cuneiform. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform) This intricate system of wedge-shaped marks pressed into clay tablets allowed the recording of inventories, laws, and narratives, marking a significant improvement around how humankind preserved and disseminated  knowledge. This allowed information to outlive its author and be shared with audiences for the first time. The impact of this technology cannot be overstated; it's easily on par with the invention of the wheel and fire. (TODO: reference)

Tablets were a good start, but they were hardly portable. This lead to the invention of paper by the Chinese around the 1st century AD. Then the printing press, invented by Johannes Gutenberg in 15th century Europe, took the revolution a step further by making the process easier and widely available. Knowledge was no longer the exclusive domain of the affluent and the clergy; it was accessible to anyone who could read. Like cuneiform and paper before it, this technology permanently changed the way humanity communicated, and the resulting impact, again, cannot be overstated.

The evolution from spoken word to written, then from expensive to cheap, set up the desktop and internet revolutions of the late 20th century, followed by the explosion of smartphone usage, which made communication as cheap and plentiful as it’s ever been. (TODO: might be nice to show the explosion of content online) Today, the combination of the internet and mobile means we've never had more content, in reach of as many people (both in absolute terms and per capita), being produced by more people. Yet the technology we're using to communicate multimedia concepts has stayed surprisingly static for the last 50 years.

We used to speak around campfires, whereas now we record podcasts, Instagram stories, and video chat. But at their heart, it's all just verbal communication. We used to write stories, first on caves, then on tablets, then on paper. Now we've added websites, status updates, ebooks, and group texts, but and their heart, they're all just textual communication. You can tell the same stories about music and video; music has always been music, even as the technology powering them changes and evolves. Movies have always been movies, whether black and white, full color, 3d, or VR. And the consumption experiences for all have stayed largely the same as well. We still watch movies and plays in theatres, we still listen to music on our own or as part of a group concert. We still watch people tell stories, whether around a campfire, on YouTube, or at a stand-up comedy show. The more things change, the more they stay the same.

But by thinking of a modern Kindle as a digital book, or a YouTube video as a digital version of a live performance, or a news story as a digital version of a newspaper article, we're overlooking the ways that communication be more impactful as a user. A lack of vision is a common human trait: the first websites emulated physical spaces, and the first TV shows simply aimed video cameras at live radio shows. It takes time for creators to appreciate the nuances and differences in new technologies. It takes time to evolve from I Love Lucy to Game of Thrones, and in the future we'll look back at Game of Thrones as being charmingly outdated. Storytelling will never get old, but the delivery mechanisms will only improve.

### A survey of multimedia in the current day

**Todos/References**
* Blah blah blah

**Todos/Other**
* Blah blah blah

To understand how multimedia is created in modern times, imagine writing a blog post for yourself or as part of a broader media organisation. What tools would you have at your disposal?

* Text input (typically the default input method)
* Images (usually)
* Video (common, but not a given)

And that's it. If you wanted to add something as simple as a gallery or slideshow of photos, you'd require a special widget or component. What if you wanted to show a comparison between two images, perhaps showing a before and after of the effects of hurricane? Again, you'd be out of luck without someone coding the component for you. Or what if you wanted to provide some light interactivity to help explain a complex concept? Not possible unless you can explain it in text, images, or maybe a video. It's hard to argue that "text, sometimes with an image embedded in it," really counts as interactive multimedia. It's pretty close to reading a magazine or newspaper from 100 years ago, the only difference being that it's delivered over the internet, to a screen, with hyperlinks.

On the other end of the interactive spectrum, we have games. You can make the argument that the subject matter addressed by games is even more vast than the entire collected works of books in all of human recorded history. The difference is in interactivity. Romeo and Juliet is just another love story, but if you played Romeo and Juliet as a simulated experience, you could drive the story however you want. By definition, a book will have one ending. By definition, many games will be expected to have multiple endings, multiple paths to get there, and a sense of autonomy that makes each experience necessarily different from anyone else's experience. Citizen Kane is an epic movie about a legendary character. A single interactive product like World of Warcraft aims to provide multiple storylines just as epic and personalised as Citizen Kane to the more than 100 million people who have played it. In terms of sheer quantity, there's no contest which experience provides a wider range of experiences.

But quantity isn't the only metric, of course. When you're reading a news article, you're not seeking a game of pinball. When you're playing Minecraft, you're not seeking to read a 300 page book of lore. (TODO: Refer to The Grain of the Web) As Frank Chimero demonstrated in Grain of the Web, effective communication with text and media requires using the right tool for the job. A well-argued essay wouldn’t work as well as a series of images. A comic wouldn’t work as well described orally. A painting wasn’t meant to be a video. There is a “grain” to each media type that guides authors towards how to best use them, and if you go against the grain, they are less effective. The key to successful design and communication is to work within the space. I propose that multimedia artists have gotten complacent, where we have simple CMS systems for writing with text + images and overly complex game authoring environments for anything more complex than text. There's a vast space in between those extremes that warrants a closer look. To date, the closest word most people have used to describe this space is "simulation."

Simulations live between full-fledged games and traditional written content. They provide a bridge between the static and the interactive, allowing users to manipulate variables and observe the outcomes. This makes simulations particularly effective for demonstrating complex systems or processes that would be difficult to explain with text or images alone. For example, in the context of climate science, a simulation could allow users to increase or decrease greenhouse gas emissions and observe the effects on global temperature, sea level, and more. The interactivity of simulations supports active learning, as users can explore the system or process at their own pace, experimenting with different scenarios and seeing the results. This helps users to understand not just what happens, but why it happens, deepening their understanding and knowledge retention. This is not a new field, but it's one that's been poorly defined and advocated for for many years. The closest we've come in the popular imagination is when Bret Victor identified this spectrum of communication and coined the term “Explorable Explanations” to describe products that live in the middle of the two extremes: written content that uses interactive components to communicate concepts more effectively.


### “Explorable Explanations” and “Active Essays”

Bret Victor introduced the concept of Explorable Explanations to offer a new way of presenting and interacting with text. The core idea is to transform text from mere information to be consumed into an environment to think in. This was envisioned as an umbrella project with the goal of encouraging truly active reading. To make abstract concepts more concrete, Victor proposed the development of reactive documents that allow readers to manipulate authors' assumptions and see the consequences, explorable examples that make abstract concepts concrete, and contextual information that allows readers to learn related material just-in-time and cross-check the author's claims.

Victor's ideas, however, were not completely new. Computing pioneer Alan Kay had previously discussed the concept of active essays which blended computer-based simulations with explanatory text. This was a part of his vision for transforming the computer into a new kind of medium for creative thought, combining the dynamic and interactive nature of the computer with the narrative and argumentative strength of the essay.

These ideas have led to a surge of explorations in the field. Notably, Nicky Case has been instrumental in bringing these ideas to life. One notable example is "Parable of the Polygons", a web-based interactive simulation game that visually demonstrates how small individual biases can lead to large collective biases, thus providing an explorable explanation of systemic societal biases.

(TODO: I have so many references and citations I can put here, so I should)

This form of explanation has gained traction, with many writers and educators appreciating the value of interactivity in conveying complex ideas. In particular, the medium has been praised for enabling the reader to gain a deeper understanding of the topic by actively participating in the process of exploration and discovery.

Explorable explanations have been further explored and written about by a variety of authors. In particular, the field of education has seen significant interest, with proponents highlighting the potential for these interactive texts to revolutionise learning by promoting active engagement and critical thinking. Other fields, such as journalism and data science, have also begun to incorporate explorable explanations as a means of communicating complex ideas to the public. Overall, Victor's vision for transforming people's relationship with text is finding resonance, sparking a wave of innovative explorations that have the potential to reshape how we interact with information.

But despite all the examples people were experimenting with, it was hard to point to a single example and say “this is an explorable explanation.” What’s the difference between a simulation, a game, an educational game, an explorable, or a multimedia experience? And then came snowfall.

(TODO: Refer to that one thesis about explorable explanations that asks a lot of these questions, gets some answers, but largely shrugs it off)

### The Importance of Snowfall

Andrew Kueneman

(TODO: source, source, source)
(TODO: do a google scholar search for snowfall — was it before explorable explanations? Nope, explorable explanations was 2011 and snowfall was in the last few days of 2012)

When The New York Times released the "Snow Fall" interactive feature in 2012, it sparked waves of excitement within the digital media industry. This unprecedented piece of multimedia storytelling, a long-form article punctuated by interactive graphics, videos, and immersive animations, seemed to herald the dawn of a new era for online media. Snowfall was a trailblazer, representing a powerful blend of traditional journalistic storytelling and interactive elements, promising an engaging and immersive reader experience.

The innovative approach of Snowfall was met with critical acclaim, winning the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing. Its influence was quickly seen in the proliferation of 'Snowfall-like' features across the digital media landscape, as news outlets and other media organisations sought to emulate its success. The term 'Snowfall' even became a verb within the industry, describing the process of creating rich, multimedia experiences within a long-form article.

However, the initial enthusiasm surrounding Snowfall was soon tempered by the realisation of its inherent challenges. Despite its apparent success, the production of Snowfall was a costly endeavour, both in terms of time and resources. It required a team of skilled developers and designers working intensively over several months to bring the project to fruition. This high level of investment was not a feasible model for most media outlets, particularly for those with smaller budgets or shorter timelines.

Furthermore, the feature was not without technical issues. Users reported numerous bugs, with interactive elements often failing to load properly or behaving inconsistently across different devices and browsers. The high-quality multimedia content, while visually impressive, was also demanding on system resources, leading to slow load times and performance issues for users with less powerful computers or slower internet connections.

These shortcomings highlighted a crucial paradox at the heart of the Snowfall experience. While it demonstrated the immense potential of interactive media and storytelling, it also underscored the technical and economic hurdles that must be overcome to make such experiences accessible and enjoyable for all users. This points towards the need for more scalable and efficient approaches to producing interactive content, as well as better optimisation strategies to ensure smooth performance across a range of devices and connection speeds.

(TODO: this is a great place for talking about the grain of the web more)

### The Snowfall backlash (The Grain of the Web)
In 2015, three years after the launch of Snowfall, Frank Chimero published "The Web's Grain", a seminal piece offering a deep reflection on web design and digital interaction. Chimero's exploration of the web's "grain" can provide us with a valuable perspective when reassessing Snowfall's legacy, as it posits an essential understanding of the fundamental characteristics and potentials of the web as a medium.

The concept of "grain", as Chimero describes it, is a metaphor borrowed from woodworking. It represents the innate tendencies and capacities of any medium or material. The best and most resonant works of design align with the grain of their medium, working with it rather than against it. This notion serves as a guiding principle, illuminating a path for web design that embraces the unique capabilities and affordances of the web.

For Chimero, the web's grain is characterised by flexibility, interconnectedness, and "edgelessness", a term he uses to describe the web's lack of defined boundaries. He argues that a well-designed digital space is fluid and adaptive, reflecting the mutable, ever-changing nature of the web.

While Snowfall was a groundbreaking and pioneering exploration of multimedia storytelling, it was, arguably, somewhat against the web's grain in its execution. The project was complex, resource-intensive, and often glitchy, which resulted in it failing to load properly or behave consistently across different devices and browsers. Moreover, its approach was not scalable for most media outlets, particularly those with limited resources.

Chimero might argue that this approach ran counter to the web's inherent fluidity and adaptability. While the project harnessed some of the web's potential for rich multimedia storytelling, its complex design and performance issues revealed a misalignment with the web's grain.

Yet, despite these flaws, the concept behind Snowfall aligns with Chimero's vision of embracing the web's unique capacities. The New York Times's interactive feature represents an attempt to leverage the web's potential for creating immersive, interconnected experiences that transcend traditional linear storytelling. Even though its execution was not perfect, the ambition and innovation behind Snowfall signalled a step towards more engaging and interactive forms of online content.

Chimero’s essay urges us to step back from the precipice of overcomplicated, overly-ambitious design and to reconsider the fundamental properties of the web – a more versatile, flexible and inherently complex medium than any that have come before. This call for a return to simplicity, however, is not a call for stagnation or resistance against innovation. Rather, it is a challenge to embrace the medium in its fullness, harness its unique properties, and wield these attributes to push the boundaries of digital storytelling.

Seen through this lens, "Snowfall" isn’t so much a failed experiment, but an important milestone that stretched the conceptual limits of online communication. It unveiled a tantalising glimpse of the web’s potential while laying bare the challenges of aligning with the web’s unique grain. This experience showed us the value in creating digital narratives that are innovative, accessible, and engaging – narratives that ride with the web's grain rather than against it.

The promise of Snowfall, then, isn't in the specific form it took but rather the vision it represented – a vision of using the web's unique capacities for storytelling, learning, and understanding. It's about blending the strengths of the medium with content, not wedging content into unwieldy software experiences.

However, to translate this vision into practice, we need to focus on what makes online documents successful: text, video, images, and embedded widgets. These components are not just passive containers of information, but dynamic instruments of communication, each with its unique way of engaging users and conveying meaning.

In addition to these, we introduce the concept of responsive communication - an innovative approach that focuses on enhancing comprehension and interactivity. To truly harness the web's grain, we must design digital experiences that respond to users' actions and adapt to their needs. These can range from interactive diagrams that users can manipulate to gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter, to smart annotations that provide additional information on demand, to simulations that allow users to explore different scenarios and outcomes.

These components create a more holistic and immersive experience. They do not function as separate, disconnected pieces wedged into a page but as a cohesive whole. They become a part of the narrative, supplementing and enhancing the main text rather than distracting from it.

But, as we move towards embracing these new tools and approaches, we must not lose sight of the core of all communication: words. The fundamental purpose of any digital communication, no matter how visually stunning or interactively engaging, is to convey meaning through content.

Therefore, we propose creating a component library - a collection of versatile, reusable components that seamlessly integrate into the narrative flow, enhancing the storytelling and learning process. A tool like this allows us to avoid the pitfall of over-complication, keeping us grounded in our ultimate goal: to communicate effectively.

In essence, our journey from Snowfall, through The Web's Grain, and back to words represents a shift in our understanding and approach to digital storytelling. It's about recognising the unique grain of the web and using it to create more meaningful, effective, and engaging experiences. It's about finding that sweet spot between innovation and accessibility, where the technology enhances the narrative rather than overwhelming it.

### Going Against the Grain in Games

In the world of digital games, the concept of "grain" can also be applied to understand the inherent nature and purpose of different game genres. Just as Frank Chimero described the grain of the web, games have an innate tendency and purpose that guide their design and player experience. When a game's design aligns with its grain, it creates a cohesive and immersive experience. Conversely, going against the grain can lead to disjointed and unsettling gameplay.

**Minecraft: A Sandbox with Limits**

Take the example of Minecraft, a sandbox game that allows players an almost unlimited freedom to build, explore, and create within a pixelated world. Its grain lies in the open-ended nature of exploration and creativity. Players can construct vast cities, intricate machines, or even write simple texts within the game. However, this grain has its limits.

Imagine being tasked with reading an entire novel within Minecraft. Though technically possible, this would be a jarring experience that goes against the grain of the game. Minecraft's environment is not conducive to long-form reading. The blocky aesthetics, navigation mechanics, and interactive dynamics are not designed to provide a comfortable or engaging reading experience. The novel's presence in the game would feel unnatural and dissonant, as it conflicts with the inherent tendencies of the game to provide spatial and tactile exploration.

**Visual Novels: When Games Meet Literature**

Visual novels, on the other hand, provide a unique intersection of gaming and reading. They are designed to offer interactive storytelling experiences, where players make choices that guide the narrative. Here, the grain is a blend of reading and light interactivity, where the emphasis is on narrative immersion rather than complex gameplay mechanics.

Now, imagine if a visual novel suddenly transitioned into a fast-paced action game without warning. This shift would be jolting and might feel inappropriate within the context of the story. It would go against the grain of what a visual novel is meant to be. The player is prepared for a reading experience with decision-making, not an intense battle requiring rapid reflexes.

**Embracing the Grain**

The examples of Minecraft and visual novels illustrate that understanding the grain of a game is essential to creating a harmonious player experience. When developers recognise and work with the grain, they can create games that feel intuitive and engaging. Straying from this grain can lead to confusion, discomfort, or dissatisfaction.

This is not to say that experimentation and innovation should be avoided. Games can and should push boundaries, explore new concepts, and challenge conventions. However, these explorations should be done with a mindful understanding of the grain and how it shapes player expectations and experiences.

In essence, the grain of a game is a compass that guides design decisions, helping to align the game's mechanics, aesthetics, and interactivity with its core purpose. Recognising and embracing this grain enables designers to create experiences that resonate with players, offering them journeys that feel natural, engaging, and deeply satisfying. Conversely, going against the grain without thoughtful consideration can lead to a dissonance that disrupts the player's connection to the game, undermining its impact and appeal.

The lessons learned from understanding the grain in games can also be applied to other mediums and disciplines, including web design and multimedia storytelling. It's a concept that transcends boundaries, offering insights into how we can create more resonant and effective experiences across various platforms and formats. It's about finding that harmony between form and function, where the medium enhances the message rather than working against it.

### Going Against the Grain in Data Visualisations

Data visualisation represents a powerful tool for communicating complex information, trends, and insights in an accessible and compelling manner. The field experienced a significant surge in popularity in the early 2000s, largely thanks to the pioneering work of Edward Tufte. Tufte's groundbreaking books, including "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information" and "Envisioning Information," have inspired countless designers and analysts to explore the potential of visual communication, especially in the context of charts and graphs.

**Embracing the Grain: Tufte's Vision**

Tufte's philosophy emphasised maximising the data-ink ratio, putting more data points into visual communication without unnecessary decorations or embellishments. He advocated for clarity, simplicity, and integrity in design, recognising the unique grain of data visualisation as a medium for conveying quantitative information efficiently and effectively.

This approach has led to some remarkable examples of data visualisation. Sites like 538 and pudding.cool have become renowned for their innovative and insightful visualisations, harnessing the grain of data to offer readers deeper understanding and engagement with complex topics.

**Going Against the Grain: Poor Imitations**

However, the popularity of data visualisation has also led to a proliferation of poor imitations that go against the grain of what the medium is meant to accomplish. These misguided attempts often miss the essence of data visualisation, reducing it to mere graphic design projects without considering the underlying purpose and potential of the medium.

Many bad visualisations seem to prioritise style over substance, obscuring the data's meaning behind flashy visuals, confusing layouts, or unnecessary complexity. In some cases, the information could be more clearly and effectively communicated through simple bullet points or concise text. These examples fail to leverage the unique properties of data visualisation, losing the opportunity to enhance comprehension and insight.

For example, a chart that employs a bewildering array of colours, shapes, and lines without clear labelling or logical organisation can confuse rather than clarify. Such a chart might look visually appealing but fails to convey the intended message or insights, leaving readers frustrated and uninformed.

**Tufte's Misstep: Redesigning the iPhone Stocks App**

Even Tufte himself, the champion of data-rich visualisations, made a notable misstep when he attempted to redesign the iPhone stocks app. His design was guided by his traditional approach of maximising data density, without considering the specific context and constraints of mobile design.

The result was a cluttered and overwhelming interface that went against the grain of what mobile users typically seek: clear, simple, and user-friendly experiences. Tufte's redesign failed to recognise the unique grain of mobile design, which prioritises ease of use, readability, and focused information delivery.

**Striking the Balance**

The challenges and missteps in the field of data visualisation highlight the importance of understanding and working with the grain of the medium. It's not enough to simply present data in a visual form; designers must recognise the inherent tendencies and capacities of data visualisation as a unique form of communication.

Good data visualisation is not just about aesthetics; it's about conveying meaning, fostering understanding, and engaging the audience. It requires a careful balance of creativity and discipline, innovation and clarity, form and function.

Poorly designed visualisations that go against the grain serve as a cautionary tale, reminding us that adherence to fundamental principles and respect for the medium's grain is essential. It's about recognising the unique characteristics of data visualisation and using them to enhance rather than hinder communication.

**And so...**

In the ever-evolving field of data visualisation, the concept of working with or against the grain remains a guiding principle. From Tufte's pioneering vision to contemporary explorations and missteps, the journey of data visualisation offers valuable lessons in understanding the medium's unique grain.

Whether it's games like Minecraft or visual novels, or the complex world of data visualisation, recognising and embracing the grain leads to resonant and effective experiences. Conversely, going against the grain without thoughtful consideration can lead to dissonance and confusion. It's a concept that transcends disciplines, offering insights into how we can create more meaningful and engaging experiences across various platforms and formats. The challenge lies in finding that harmony between innovation and accessibility, where the technology and design enhance the narrative, not overwhelm it.

### Innovating Within and Beyond the Grain: Exploring New Frontiers in Text

The concept of working with the grain of a medium has been a guiding principle in various artistic and communicative endeavours. It reflects an alignment with the innate tendencies and capacities of a given medium, allowing creators to craft resonant and effective experiences. However, innovation and exploration often require stepping beyond established boundaries, breaking traditional moulds, and forging new paths. This adventurous spirit of exploration can lead to groundbreaking works that redefine our understanding of the medium itself.

**Breaking the Mould: "House of Leaves"**

An exemplary case of breaking outside the bounds of traditional artistic forms is Mark Z. Danielewski's novel "House of Leaves." Unlike the vast majority of books that can be easily transformed into ePubs or other digital formats, "House of Leaves" defies simple categorisation. It plays with visual design, page numbers, colours, and special codes, making it closer to an artistic artefact than a simple book.

The novel's complex layout and multifaceted narrative structure are integral to the reading experience, and they cannot be replicated in standard digital formats. Footnotes lead to appendices, mirrored text demands physical interaction, and different fonts and colours signify various layers of the story. This design goes against the grain of traditional book publishing, turning the physical book into a part of the narrative itself.

This deliberate choice to defy the conventional grain of book design has led to a unique and immersive reading experience, one that challenges readers' expectations and engages them on a deeper level. "House of Leaves" is not just a novel; it is a literary labyrinth that invites exploration, reflection, and active participation.

**Adapting to the Environment: "How Music Works"**

In his book "How Music Works," David Byrne explores how different kinds of music are impacted by the environment. He illustrates how musical compositions have evolved to reflect the characteristics of the spaces in which they are performed. From grand concert halls to intimate chambers, from boomboxes to headphones, music has adapted to resonate with the grain of the listening experience.

Byrne's insights reveal how understanding and aligning with the grain of the environment can lead to powerful and harmonious musical expressions. The art is not only in crafting the song but also in understanding the "concert hall" it will be played in.

**"Homestuck": A Multi-Modal Marvel**

"Homestuck," created by Andrew Hussie, is a webcomic that delights in transcending traditional boundaries and defying categorisation. It is a unique blend of illustration, text, interactive games, and videos, creating a multi-modal experience that engages readers on multiple levels. The narrative is not confined to static images and words on a page; it spills into interactive Flash games, YouTube videos, and even physical merchandise. Hussie's creation doesn't just adhere to the grain of conventional storytelling but revels in exploring the myriad possibilities of digital media. This makes "Homestuck" not merely a webcomic but an expansive narrative universe that invites active participation and exploration.

**Web Alternate Reality Games (ARGs)**

The concept of web Alternate Reality Games (ARGs) further expands on this idea of multi-modal storytelling. ARGs blur the lines between fiction and reality, offering immersive experiences that extend beyond traditional media. Players interact with the game through various channels such as websites, social media, phone calls, and real-world events. Clues are dropped everywhere, and players must actively engage with the content, often collaborating with others, to unravel the story. The game is not confined to a single platform or format; it permeates the player's reality, turning the entire world into a playground.

**"LOST": Transmedia Storytelling**

The popular TV show "LOST" explored this space of transmedia storytelling by creating an ARG that accompanied the series. Beyond the television screen, "LOST" fans could delve into websites, fake commercials, and other media that expanded the show's universe. These additional layers of content provided deeper insights into the characters and mysteries of the show, allowing fans to actively participate in the narrative. This approach went against the grain of traditional television watching, turning passive viewers into active participants in a broader storytelling experience.

**Tying It All Together**

Both "Homestuck" and the ARG elements of "LOST" represent a new frontier in storytelling, one that embraces the interconnectedness and flexibility of modern media. They demonstrate that the grain of storytelling is not fixed or rigid but can be shaped, stretched, and reimagined to create rich and engaging experiences. By weaving together various media and allowing readers or viewers to actively engage with the content, creators can build immersive worlds that transcend the limitations of traditional formats. This multi-modal approach to storytelling is not just an innovation; it's a celebration of the endless possibilities of artistic expression in the digital age. Whether through the sprawling narrative of "Homestuck" or the layered mystery of "LOST," these works challenge us to rethink what storytelling can be and invite us to participate in shaping its future.

### Innovating from Inspiration

Inspired by examples like "House of Leaves," "Homestuck," the adaptive nature of music as explored in David Byrne's "How Music Works," and the multi-modal experiences of Alternate Reality Games (ARGs) like those associated with "LOST," we can consider how to innovate new ways of working with text that push the medium forward. How can we align with expectations (the grain) while also uncovering new approaches? Here are some metrics to consider, followed by examples:

**Interactivity:** Enhancing text with interactive elements can create more engaging and immersive experiences. Examples include explorable explanations, as proposed by Bret Victor, interactive fiction like "Homestuck," and educational simulations that blend traditional reading with active engagement.

**Multimodality:** Combining text with visual, auditory, or tactile elements can create richer and more nuanced expressions. Graphic novels, augmented reality books like "House of Leaves," and audio-enhanced e-books are examples of this approach.

**Narrative Complexity:** Experimenting with non-linear narratives, multiple perspectives, or unconventional layouts can challenge readers' expectations and offer new ways of storytelling. Examples include hypertext fiction, collaborative writing platforms, and experimental literature like "Only Revolutions" by Danielewski, as well as transmedia storytelling such as the ARG elements in "LOST."

**Personalisation and Adaptation:** Creating adaptive and personalised reading experiences can align with individual readers' needs, preferences, and contexts. Examples include adaptive learning materials, personalised news feeds like those explored by data visualisation experts such as Tufte, and AI-powered content curation.

**Accessibility:** Innovating ways to make text more accessible to diverse readers, including those with disabilities, can expand the reach and impact of the written word. Examples include text-to-speech technologies, braille e-books, and inclusive design practices.

**And so...**

Innovation within and beyond the grain is an exciting frontier in the exploration of text as a medium. Whether adhering to the grain or boldly defying it, creators have the opportunity to craft meaningful, engaging, and transformative experiences. From the artistic experimentation of "House of Leaves" to the multi-modal storytelling of "Homestuck," the adaptive evolution of music, the intricate puzzles of web ARGs, and the ongoing exploration of digital text, the journey is filled with potential.

It's about striking a balance between tradition and innovation, resonance and dissonance, familiarity and novelty. It's about recognising the grain, understanding its limitations, and pushing its boundaries. It's about building not just the song but also the concert hall, not just the words but also the world in which they live.

The challenge and opportunity lie in our willingness to explore, to question, to experiment, and to innovate. The grain of the medium is not a constraint but a starting point, a foundation upon which we can build, expand, and reimagine. The future of text is a canvas waiting to be painted, a story waiting to be told, a grain waiting to be explored. Whether it's a multi-layered digital comic, a groundbreaking television show, or a novel that defies conventional reading, the potential is vast, and the grain is ripe for exploration. So let's explore!


### An Augmented Text Pattern Library

**Before and After Slider**

What it is:

A 'before and after' slider is a visual tool that allows users to compare two versions of an image by sliding a control left and right. It can reveal changes, contrasts, or progress over time in a way that is immediate and striking.

Notable examples:

This tool has been used effectively in various fields, including journalism, where The New York Times has used it to show the impacts of natural disasters on landscapes, and in retail, where it's used to demonstrate the effects of products.

Why it's better than simple text:

Text can describe differences, but the slider allows for a visual, direct comparison that can be more impactful and easier to grasp. It's a concrete, visual way to present contrasts or changes.

Why it's better than launching a widget:

The slider is incorporated directly into the page, offering a seamless experience. There's no need to open a separate widget or leave the current context, ensuring the flow of information remains uninterrupted.

Inventors: The exact origin is unclear, but it's a widely-used tool in web development, with many open-source versions available.

**Last Read Indicator**

What it is:

A 'last read' indicator is a tool that marks the last point in a text that a user read, allowing them to pick up where they left off when they return to the document.

Notable examples: (look for some)

Why it's better than simple text:

Reading long documents can be daunting, and it's easy to lose your place. The 'last read' indicator solves this problem by providing a visual bookmark, enhancing usability.

Why it's better than launching a widget:

The indicator is built into the document, meaning it's always present and doesn't interrupt the reading experience. There's no need to launch a separate tool or navigate away from the page.

Inventors: probably none?

**Article Diff**

What it is:

An 'article diff' tool allows users to compare different versions of an article or document, showing the additions, deletions, and modifications between them. This is similar to the 'track changes' feature in word processing software but integrated into the web interface.

Notable examples: 

Wikipedia uses a similar feature to track changes in its pages, while GitHub uses it for tracking changes in code.

Why it's better than simple text:

It provides an efficient way to see the evolution of a document or the changes made, beyond what could be communicated through text alone.

Why it's better than launching a widget: 

An 'article diff' is directly incorporated into the webpage, meaning users can instantly access and navigate the changes without the need to load a separate tool or application.

Inventors:

The concept is borrowed from programming, where 'diff' tools have long been used to compare different versions of code.

**Interactive Graph (Compound Interest)**

What it is: 

An interactive graph for compound interest visualizes how an initial investment grows over time, taking into account both the initial deposit and the accumulated interest. Users can manipulate variables (like interest rate, time, or initial deposit) to see how changes impact the growth of the investment.

Why it's better than simple text: 

Text explanations of compound interest can be abstract and hard to grasp. An interactive graph makes the concept concrete and allows users to experiment and see the impact of different variables directly.

Why it's better than launching a widget: Embedding the interactive graph into the page keeps the user in the context of the broader content, maintaining the flow of information and engagement.

Notable examples: 

Various financial and educational websites use interactive compound interest calculators, such as Investopedia and Khan Academy. (Sorted.co.nz?)

Inventors:

The concept of an interactive compound interest graph likely arose with the advent of financial technology tools designed to educate and engage consumers in personal finance.

**Summarise Widget**

What it is:

A 'summarise' widget is a tool that automatically generates a concise summary of a larger text. This could be a paragraph that summarises an article, key points from a speech, or the main ideas of a chapter, for instance.

Why it's better than simple text: 

It provides a quick way to understand the main points of a long text, offering a 'digest' version for those short on time or seeking to preview the content.

Why it's better than launching a widget:

The summarise widget can be built directly into the webpage, immediately available to the user without interrupting their reading flow.

Notable examples: 

Some online learning platforms use this tool to provide summaries of lengthy lectures or course materials.

Inventors: 

Summarisation technology has been developed by many companies and researchers in the field of natural language processing and machine learning.

**Digital Patina**. 

What it is: 

Digital patina refers to design elements that change over time to reflect usage, akin to how physical objects acquire a patina with age. This can take many forms on a website, such as a colour change on frequently-clicked buttons or wear marks on often-viewed pages.

Why it's better than simple text: 

Digital patina adds a layer of interaction and personalisation that simple text can't provide, making the user experience more engaging and visually interesting.

Why it's better than launching a widget: 

Digital patina is integrated into the design of the page or site, subtly enhancing the user experience without the need for launching separate widgets.

Notable examples: 

(BBC example from 2003 or so)

Inventors: BBC perhaps?

**Cite Pull-Forward**. 

What it is:

A 'cite pull-forward' is a feature that brings citation information (such as the author, publication date, or source title) into the main body of text when you hover over or click on an in-text citation. It provides an easy way for readers to check sources without leaving their place in the text.

Why it's better than simple text:

It provides an instant, convenient way for readers to verify and understand the context of information, improving transparency and trust in the content.

Why it's better than launching a widget:

The 'cite pull-forward' function maintains the reader's engagement and focus, offering a smoother reading experience compared to having to navigate to a separate widget or the end of the document for the full citation.

Notable examples:

Some academic databases and journal websites incorporate a similar feature, improving the reading experience for researchers.

Inventors: (I think the guy who thinks AI will kill us all did this first?)

### Limitations

When Steve Jobs first saw a demo of the Segway scooter, he was misquoted as saying “someday they’ll build cities around this.” The actual quote wasn’t nearly as positive. He was dismissively saying “you’re asking cities to redesign themselves around this.” His point was that products need to coexist within the environment they find themselves in, not arrogantly believe the world will reorient itself to accept the product. The same is true with augmented text. Blogging software and professional-grade content management systems have a certain pattern: type words, add some multimedia to them, and publish. None of the ideas outlined in this paper would work with existing software, and the average CMS or blog user does not have the skills to write the software themselves. So what can we do?

(Talk about that here)

MASTERS OF DESIGN STUDY RESEARCH PROPOSAL 

DRIL stream: Data.Mine 

Proposed Supervisor: Walter Langelaar 

Funding (if applicable): N/A 

External Partner/s (if applicable): N/A 

Working Research Project title: 

Augmented Text: A New Frontier in Communication 

Project Overview: 

This work will explore the exciting but overlooked space between standard text-based content and fully interactive software. Scholars and inventors as far back as Alan Kay (2003) have called for the creation of “active essays” and more recently Bret Victor has advocated for Explorable Explanations, (2011) which inspired powerful new works such as the Pulitzer-winning Snowfall from the New York Times (2012). Still, the practice is outside the mainstream. My research will help the reader think about text as an interactive experience where writing isn’t just something to be consumed, but is instead an environment to think in. 

Research Project Description: 

The research will feature an survey of innovative and influential examples of augmented text to date. From these sources, I will distill core concepts, strategies, and approaches that have proven successful in engaging readers and enhancing understanding. The central focus of my work will be contributing to this under-appreciated field. I'll build a comprehensive pattern library featuring practical, applicable examples of augmented text techniques. 

Each pattern in the library will be accompanied by working code and an interactive prototype. These will serve as a springboard for future exploration and innovation by designers and developers. This pattern library will stand as a practical, hands-on companion to the theoretical knowledge drawn from my research. 

In this project, I am aiming to do more than just synthesize what has been done. I hope to inspire, enabling others to build on past achievements and explore new frontiers in the realm of responsive communication. After reading my work, readers will not only appreciate the art of what's been done in the past but will also be equipped to add to the future of augmented text and responsive communication. 

Research Methods: 

My research methodology will reply on on three methods: conducting a literature review, performing a contextual inquiry, and authoring a pattern library. 

The literature review will examine scholarly articles, case studies, and existing research to identify key developments, successful methods, and emerging patterns. This theoretical groundwork (Fink, 2019) will inform the subsequent stages of my research.  

Next, I’ll conduct a contextual inquiry, as delineated by Beyer and Holtzblatt (1998), to help create a narrative around my work.  I'll study the context around these methods and techniques have been used, taking into account cultural, historical, and societal factors. Rather than focusing on individual user experiences, this inquiry will shed light on broader trends, positioning my work against a wider historical and cultural backdrop. 

The centerpiece of my research will be the development of an open-sourced pattern library, inspired by the principles outlined in 'A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction' by Alexander, Ishikawa, and Silverstein (1977), to ensure my research contributes new knowledge to the field rather than solely reporting on pre-existing studies. The patterns will be informed by the insights derived from the literature review and contextual inquiry, contemporary practices, and my own design explorations. 

By applying the insights gained from the literature review and contextual inquiry to the creation of the pattern library, I aim to provide a comprehensive, practical, and innovative resource for those interested in the concepts of Augmented Text and Responsive Communication. 

Research Outputs: 

The centerpiece of this research will be a comprehensive research paper, spanning between 8,000 to 30,000 words, that lays out the history, theory, and application of Augmented Text and Responsive Communication. This document will be available in PDF form for traditional academic consumption. 

However, to fully embrace the topic of study, the same content will be presented as an interactive online essay. This digital rendition will incorporate live examples of augmented text and responsive communication, creating an experiential learning environment for readers and embodying the principles it discusses. 

Complementing the research paper, I will also produce an open-sourced pattern library. This practical resource will host a collection of interactive patterns drawn from my research, each one a fully functioning example of Augmented Text. It is my hope that this pattern library will not only illustrate the concepts discussed in the research paper but will also serve as a source of inspiration and a toolkit for other designers and developers venturing into this exciting frontier of digital communication. 

Research Plan:  

July 3rd, 2023 - August 2nd, 2023: Research proposal (1 month) 

This month will be used for gathering resources, refining the project plan, and initial readings to prepare for the MVP. 

August 3rd, 2023 - September 2nd, 2023: MVP (1 month) 

With the knowledge already gained in the field, a preliminary draft of the entire research paper will be constructed. This is a methodology that has proven successful in industry settings—create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) quickly and proceed to iterate based on its foundation. This is non-standard because a literature review typically comes first, but this will give me the best chance of success because it gives me more time to iterate. 

September 3rd, 2023 - December 2nd, 2023: Development (3 months) 

Pattern Library Development. The next three months will be dedicated to writing code for the pattern library. Leveraging the insights from the initial draft, a series of interactive examples showcasing the potential of augmented text and responsive communication will be developed. By the end of this phase, I’ll have a solid draft containing the essay and code components of my final thesis. 

The 4-month report will land on November 3rd,.  

December 3rd, 2023 - March 2nd, 2024: Literature Review (3 months) 

In these three months, the paper and code examples will be scrutinized, iterated upon, and improved. The draft research paper will be shared with peers and experts for their feedback. In parallel, a literature review will be conducted to understand how the project relates to, deviates from, and augments the existing body of knowledge. 

The 8-month report will land at the end of this phase, on March 2nd, 2024. 

March 3rd, 2024 – July 3rd, 2024:  Iteration and refinement (4 months) 

This phase will be devoted to consolidating new learnings, feedback, and insights. The objective is to enhance and expand the paper and the code examples to ensure their relevance and contribution to the field, and prepare for final submission. My ultimate goal is to create a research output that withstands academic scrutiny while contributing practically to the field. 

A final report will be delivered between April 3rd and July 2nd, 2024.
